le-parked, he was
sitting there.
COP #1: Alright, you move your car. It's his space, you can't go in head
first.
COP #2: Wait a second. Why can't he go in head first? He said the guy was just sitting over there.
COP #1: What are you talking about? This guy was here first.
COP #2: But he didn't take it.
COP #1: Hey, it's his space.
COP #2: No, it's his space.
[Cut to Jerry entering his apartment, George and Mike can be heard arguing through the window]
GEORGE: Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
MIKE: Well, you're gonna have to go to work!
GEORGE: I don't have a job!
MIKE: Neither do I!
(Jerry closes the window, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote and turns on the TV.)
REFEREE: Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. *ding*
(Jerry falls over and hides his face in the couch cushion.)
[Closing monologue]
People will kill each other for a parking space in New York because they think, 'If I don't get this one, I may never get a space.' You know? 'I'll be circling for months until somebody goes out to the Hamptons.' I think because everyone in New York City knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces. You see cars driving in New York all hours of the night. It's like Musical Chairs except everybody sat down around 1964. The problem is car manufacturers are building hundreds of thousands of new cars every year, they're not making any new spaces. That's what they should be working on. Wouldn't that be great? You go to the Auto Show, they got that big revolving turntable, and there's nothing on it. New from Chrysler, a space.
Jerry's stand-up: So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's just up there in the cockpit going (mimics looking for keys) "Oh, I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again." They tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system..."Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to the plane in my apartment." You see the technicians all running underneath the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking for the magnet "hide-a-key" under the wing..."maybe he left it up there somewhere..."
Opening scene: Jerry's apartment in the middle of the night. Jerry comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts.
JERRY's brain: What is it about sleep that makes you so thirsty? Do dreams require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there.
(Jerry notices his door is open.)
JERRY's brain: What the hell...? Why is the door open?
(Jerry looks out into the hallway, turns back into his apartment, and runs into Kramer in the dark. They both scream. Kramer turns on the light.)
JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here!?
KRAMER: Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
JERRY: You scared me!
KRAMER: It's just me.
JERRY: That's enough!
KRAMER: Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
[Jerry's apartment, daytime. We hear Jerry hurriedly trying to get in the door.]
JERRY (from outside the door): C'mon...c'mon...
(Jerry enters, sheds his jacket, drops his luggage and heads for the bathroom. He opens the door to find Kramer taking a bubble bath in his tub.)
JERRY: Kramer! What are you doing?!
KRAMER: What does it look like I'm doing? What?
JERRY: Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
KRAMER: Alright, alright...
JERRY: C'mon!
KRAMER: Sorry.
JERRY: Move it! Move it! Get going!
KRAMER: My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
JERRY (from inside the bathroom): Is that my towel?
(Kramer loses the towel in the hallway and throws it on Jerry's floor from the other side of the door.)
[Jerry's hallway at night. Jerry approaches his door with a girlfriend.]
GIRLFRIEND: I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
JERRY: Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
GIRLFRIEND: I'm from Witchita, so...
JERRY: Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
GIRLFRIEND: Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!
JERRY: The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
GIRLFRIEND: That was close!
JERRY: Did you see the look on that guy's face?
GIRLFRIEND: You were so fast with those keys. (They prepare to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.)
JERRY: Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
JERRY: All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
KRAMER: Oh, come on!
JERRY: No, come on!
KRAMER: What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
JERRY: It was sold out!
KRAMER: Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
JERRY: That's the point.
KRAMER: What point?
JERRY: Just, look, just give the keys.
KRAMER: Just give me another chance!
JERRY: Don't ask me!
KRAMER: I'm asking you!
JERRY: I'm telling you.
KRAMER: You're joking.
JERRY: I'm serious!
KRAMER: It's not going to happen again!
JERRY: Yes it will, now give me those keys!
(Jerry and Kramer begin struggling over the keys. Kramer loses his footing and falls on the floor, taking his girlfriend down with him.)
KRAMER (getting up): O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're going to regret this. (He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.)
[Jerry's apartment, the next day. Jerry is now giving his spare keys to Elaine.]
JERRY: So put 'em in a safe place.
ELAINE: I will.
JERRY: Where?
ELAINE: I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
JERRY: I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
ELAINE: Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
JERRY: I can't.
)There's a gentle knock at the door.)
ELAINE (mouths the words): Is that Kramer? (Jerry nods.)
JERRY: Who's there?
KRAMER (in hallway): Uh, Kramer. (Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.) Oh, hi...uh...you got the...
ELAINE: Oh, I'm not, uh...
KRAMER: No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
ELAINE: Jerry, give him the keys back.
JERRY: Elaine...
(Elaine tries to give the keys to Kramer, but Jerry won't let her. Jerry and Elaine begin struggling over the keys. Kramer breaks it up.)
KRAMER: I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
JERRY: Take the keys.
KRAMER: I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
JERRY: O.K.!
KRAMER: Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
JERRY: Your spare set?
KRAMER: That's right.
JERRY: You want 'em back?
KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
(Jerry takes a huge ring with hundreds of keys on it out of his drawer, and hands it to Kramer. Kramer begins going through them.)
[the coffee shop. Kramer is now giving the huge keyring to George.]
GEORGE: Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
KRAMER: Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
GEORGE: Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
KRAMER: Well, you can get 'em back.
GEORGE: I suppose I could.
KRAMER: Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
GEORGE: Me?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
GEORGE: Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
WAITRESS: Hi, are you ready to order? (George tries to order, but Kramer interrupts.)
KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George): Do you ever yearn?
GEORGE: Yearn? Do I yearn?
KRAMER: I yearn.
GEORGE: You yearn.
KRAMER: Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
GEORGE: Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
KRAMER (in disgust): Look at you.
GEORGE: Aw, Kramer, don't start...
KRAMER (moving back to the othe side of the booth): You're wasting your life.
GEORGE: I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
KRAMER: O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: You got money?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: Do you have a woman?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: Do you have any prospects?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: You got anything on the horizon?
GEORGE: Uh...no.
KRAMER: Do you have any action at all?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
GEORGE: I like to get the Daily News!
KRAMER: George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
GEORGE: Why?
KRAMER: I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
GEORGE: Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
KRAMER: No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
GEORGE: "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
KRAMER: I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
GEORGE: Uh, no, I'm not.
KRAMER: Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
GEORGE: You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
KRAMER (points to his head): Up here, I'm already gone. (Kramer exits.)
[Elaine's apartment at night. George is picking up his spare keys from Elaine.]
GEORGE: Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
ELAINE: Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
GEORGE: I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
ELAINE: That's ridiculous.
GEORGE (shakes huge keyring): That's Kramer.
ELAINE: I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
GEORGE: What for?
ELAINE: 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
GEORGE: Jerry? Why?
ELAINE: 'Cause he gave me his.
GEORGE: So what?
ELAINE: So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
GEORGE: Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
ELAINE: I just said the same thing to you.
GEORGE: What?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
ELAINE: Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
[Jerry's apartment the next day.]
JERRY: Did you bring the keys?
GEORGE: Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
JERRY: This could be an emergency!
GEORGE: You never should have taken away his keys!
JERRY: I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
GEORGE: How'd the Mets do?
JERRY: They lost.
(Jerry and George open Kramer's door and poke their heads in.)
JERRY: Kramer?
(Newman walks up behind them.)
NEWMAN (startling them): Hello, boys.
JERRY: Hello, Newman.
NEWMAN: You lookin' for someone?
JERRY: Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
NEWMAN: Coy? I'm not being coy.
JERRY (to George): Is he being coy?
GEORGE: Yeah, coy.
JERRY: You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
NEWMAN (coyly): Who?
JERRY: Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
NEWMAN: Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.
JERRY: Turn around, George.
GEORGE: Sure. (Turns around.)
NEWMAN: George?
JERRY: Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
NEWMAN: Help! Help!
JERRY: Where's Kramer?
NEWMAN: HELP! (Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: What's going on?
(Newman grabs Elaine and hides behind her.)
NEWMAN: They're gonna beat me up!
GEORGE: No we're not.
JERRY: We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
NEWMAN: You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.
JERRY: Bad rap?
NEWMAN: Yeah. From you.
JERRY: Me?
NEWMAN: You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La Land. L.A.
JERRY: L.A.?
[Cut to Kramer in his car on the highway, listening to rock music. The car's engine starts to fail, then stalls. Kramer can't believe it.]
[Jerry's apartment at night]
(Jerry's at the window, George and Elaine are on the couch ).
JERRY: I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
JERRY: Huh?
ELAINE: What...?
JERRY: No, what'd you say?
ELAINE: Nothing. I didn't say anything.
JERRY: Oh, you didn't see it.
ELAINE: Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
JERRY: I heard you say something, there.
ELAINE: I didn't say anything.
JERRY: I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
GEORGE: Ask her about Kramer.
JERRY: She's drunk out of her mind.
[Cut back to Kramer with his car broken down on the side of the highway. He tries to thumb a ride.]
Jerry approaching his apartment door. He tries to unlock it, but realizes Elaine has his keys. Jerry goes to the coffee shop to call Elaine.]
JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine): Elaine? Are you there? It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are you? I'm at the coffee shop.
[Kramer's managed to hitch a ride on the back of a motorcycle.]
KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine): Hey! You ever been in an accident?
BIKER: About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! (The biker goes into a turn.) Lean! (Kramer yells.)
[Jerry in a booth at the coffee shop waiting for George. George enters, spare keys in hand.]
JERRY (applauding): Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
GEORGE: Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
JERRY: Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
GEORGE: Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
JERRY: What is the big deal?
GEORGE: Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
JERRY: First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
GEORGE: Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
JERRY: Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
GEORGE: Nope, no can do.
JERRY: George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
GEORGE: Do you wanna fight?
JERRY: Do you wanna fight?
GEORGE: I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
[Kramer's managed to hitch another ride, this time with a van full of drugged-out hippies. Kramer is telling them a story as they go down the road... ]
KRAMER: And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
HIPPIE #1: Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.
KRAMER: Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
HIPPIE #1: Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?
KRAMER: Oh, he's cold.
HIPPIE #1: Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled that crap on me (pulls out a knife) - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
HIPPIE #1: Hey, what's the rush, man?
KRAMER: Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
HIPPIE #1: Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?
KRAMER: What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
HIPPIE #2: Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, Kramer! Please, Kramer! (Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their clutches.)
[Elaine's building at night. Jerry and George approach Elaine's door, still arguing about the keys.]
JERRY: Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
GEORGE: You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
JERRY: What's that?
GEORGE: Nothing.
JERRY: I heard something.
GEORGE: Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
[Kramer's managed to hitch yet another ride, this time with a woman driving an eighteen-wheeler.]
KRAMER: So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
WOMAN: Goin' on four years.
KRAMER: Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
WOMAN: Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, you're quite the sweet-talker.
KRAMER: You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
WOMAN: You want to give it a try?
KRAMER: Really?
WOMAN: Do you know how to double-clutch?
KRAMER: Yeah.
WOMAN: Well, come on! (They trade places and Kramer gets behind the wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.)
[Jerry and George in Elaine's apartment looking for Jerry's spare keys.]
GEORGE: They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
JERRY: Well, this is great.
GEORGE: Well, what do they look like?
JERRY: They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
GEORGE: Well, they're obviously not here.
JERRY: Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
GEORGE: Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk): What is this? "Murphy Brown"?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: By Elaine Benes?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
GEORGE: Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
JERRY: Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
GEORGE: Gimme half!
JERRY: All right, here!
GEORGE: Why didn't she tell us?
JERRY (making fun): Elaine is writing a sitcom...! (Elaine enters the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.)
ELAINE: You weasels!
JERRY: What? What?
ELAINE: How dare you!
GEORGE: We hardly read anything!
JERRY: It was funny!
ELAINE: Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
JERRY: Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
ELAINE (grabs the papers from Jerry): Well, it's just a first draft!
JERRY: I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
ELAINE (turning on George): Why did you let him in?! (Shoves George.)
GEORGE: He forced me to!
JERRY: I did not!
GEORGE: Yes you did!
ELAINE: You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
JERRY: Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
ELAINE: Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
JERRY: Good!
ELAINE (to George): And I want my keys back from you!
GEORGE: What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
ELAINE: No, you can't be trusted!
GEORGE: Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
JERRY (to Elaine): And I don't want you to hold mine!
ELAINE: Good! I won't!
JERRY: Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
ELAINE: These aren't my keys!
GEORGE: Whose are these?
ELAINE: I don't know!
(Meanwhile, Kramer's finally made it to Los Angeles. He's shown roller-skating through traffic, and nearly running over some guy on a scooter.)
[Jerry and Elaine watching "Murphy Brown" in Jerry's apartment.]
ELAINE: I just thought I could write it.
JERRY: Is that something you want to do?
ELAINE: I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
JERRY: Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
ELAINE: O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
JERRY: What did you say?
ELAINE: I didn't say anything.
JERRY: I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
ELAINE (laughing): Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
JERRY: Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
[Cut to the screen of Jerry's TV.]
CANDICE BERGEN: Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary.
KRAMER: Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
CANDICE BERGEN: And you are...?
KRAMER: Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
CANDICE BERGEN: Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell.
KRAMER: Steven.
CANDICE BERGEN: Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?
KRAMER: Oh - I'm familiar with it.
CANDICE BERGEN: Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good feeling about you. (exits.)
(Episode ends with Kramer typing rapidly on his keyboard as he takes a bite out of a donut.)
Opening monologue.
It's amazing to me that people will move thousands of miles away to another city, they think nothing of it. They get on a plane, boom. They're there, they live there now. Just, uh, I'm living over there. You know, pioneers, it took years to cross the country. Now, people will move thousands of miles just for one season. I don't think any pioneers did that, you know. Yeah, it took us a decade to get there, and, uh, we stayed for the summer, it was nice, we had a pool, the kids loved it, and then we left about ten years ago and we just got back. We had a great summer, it took us 20 years and now our lives are over.
[George and Jerry enter Monk's Coffee Shop.]
GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Are you sure?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Murphy Brown, the TV show.
JERRY: C'mon, will ya?
GEORGE: Kramer was on Murphy Brown? That son of a gun!
JERRY: Something, isn't it?
GEORGE: With Candace Bergen!
JERRY: I know!
GEORGE: I've always liked her. Remember her in 'Carnal Knowledge'?
JERRY: Sure.
GEORGE: Did she show her breasts in that?
JERRY: She's not really the naked type.
GEORGE: I can't believe I missed Kramer. You know he asked me to go with him to California.
JERRY: He did?
GEORGE: Yeah, I turned him down.
JERRY: How come you didn't tell me?
GEORGE: He asked me to keep it a secret.
JERRY: But you can never keep a secret.
GEORGE: I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.
JERRY: Well, you've come a long way.
GEORGE: I've matured.
JERRY: Hey listen, the Tonight Show called me, they want me to come out and do the show on the 28th and they're giving me two free tickets to LA. You wanna go?
GEORGE: A free ticket?
JERRY: Yeah, in fact we could track down Kramer. I always felt bad about the way he left, you know? That was a mess. I never should have taken back those keys.
GEORGE: What about accommodations?
JERRY: All taken care of.
GEORGE: Is there a meal allowance? What about seat assignments? Could I have the Kosher meal? I hear the Kosher meal is good. And I need clothes. Gotta get a haircut. Gonna have to, I have to refill my allergy medication. Oh, do I need a hat? I need a hat, don't I? Could we do the Universal tour? They have that Backdraft exhibit now, that looks very cool to me...
[Kramer, backstage, talking to some aspiring young actors.]
KRAMER: So my acting technique, my personal acting technique is working with color, imagining color, then finding the emotional vibrational mood connected to the color. See, if you look through my scripts, you'll see that all my lines have a special color, so I don't memorize language, I memorize color. This way I can go through red, yellow, green, blue. And I have a full palette of emotions.
STUDIO GUARD: Hey, didn't I tell you to get out of here?
KRAMER: Uh, did you?
STUDIO GUARD: C'mon, let's go.
KRAMER: Well, I was just--
STUDIO GUARD: Yeah yeah, you were just nothing. C'mon, let's go.
KRAMER: Alright, we'll talk about this a little later. Are you an actor?
[Kramer's apartment building in LA. Singers and actors are heard practicing in the background. Kramer leaves his apartment and makes a call on the pay phone in the hall.]
VOICE: Murphy Brown.
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, uh, Candace Bergen please.
VOICE: Who's calling please?
KRAMER: Ah, well, just tell her that it's Kramer.
(Dial tone.)
KRAMER: Alright I'll uh, I'll call her at home. (To man waiting behind him) Go ahead, it's all yours.
(Helena, a neighbor, steps into the hallway.)
HELENA: Hello Kramer.
KRAMER: Oh, uh, Helena, how are you?
HELENA: I haven't worked since 1934, how do you think I am?
KRAMER: Well, that's only uh, 58 years.
HELENA: It was a Three Stooges short, "Sappy Pappy." I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary, remember?
KRAMER: Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, that was a Shemp, right?
HELENA: No, a Curly. The boys played three sailors who find a baby, the baby's been kidnapped and the police think that they did it.
KRAMER: Uh huh, right.
HELENA: But, but of course they didn't do it, the police had made an awful mistake.
KRAMER: Right.
HELENA: Moe hits Curly with an axe,
KRAMER: Uh huh.
HELENA: The Stooges catch the kidnappers,
KRAMER: Right.
HELENA: But it's too late.
KRAMER: Really.
HELENA: The baby's dead.
KRAMER: Really?
HELENA: The boys are sent to Death Row and are executed.
KRAMER: Well I don't remember that part.
HELENA: I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, you were, you were very good.
HELENA: Yeah, it was sad for a Three Stooges, what with the dead baby and the Stooges being executed and all.
KRAMER: Well, that was an unusual choice for the stooges.
HELENA: Would you like to buy me a fat-free frozen yogurt at the store, Kramer?
KRAMER: Uh, well, uh, you know I can't right now, you know, uh, I got a very big meeting, I got these people interested in my movie treatment. So, uh, I guess we'll have to make it another time, alright?
HELENA: Well No! No, don't go out there, Kramer, they'll hurt you, they'll destroy you. You'll never make it in this town, you're too sensitive like me,
KRAMER: Helena, you're wrong, you know I'm not that sensitive at all.
HELENA: I was engaged to Mickey Rooney! He left me at the altar. Kramer! Kramer!
[Jerry's apartment. George walks in with several stuffed suitcases and backpacks.]
JERRY: What is this?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: We're going on a two day trip, what are you, Diana Ross?
GEORGE: I happen to dress based on mood.
JERRY: Oh. But you essentially wear the same thing all the time.
GEORGE: Seemingly. Seemingly. But within that basic framework there are many subtle variations, only discernable to an acute observer, that reflect the many moods, the many shades, the many sides of George Costanza.
JERRY: (referring to George's outfit): And what mood is this.
GEORGE: This is Morning Mist.
[A murder scene. There's a body under a blanket and two Lieutenants are talking.]
LT. COLEMAN:: What do you figure, 20? 21?
LT. MARTEL:: Close enough.
LT. COLEMAN:: Forensics ought to be able to nail it down.
LT. MARTEL:: No ID?
LT. COLEMAN:: No ID.
LT. MARTEL:: No witnesses?
LT. COLEMAN:: Just the trees, Johnny. Pretty young thing.
LT. MARTEL:: She was. Not any more. Somebody saw to that.
LT. COLEMAN:: Sure did, Johnny. Damn shame too. What do you make of it?
LT. MARTEL:: I don't know, but I don't like it.
[Jerry and George are at the airport, in line for the metal detector.]
JERRY: Look at this guy, he's like a cat burglar. He thinks if he goes through real slow the machine won't detect him.
GEORGE: Personally I'm a little nervous about going through these things. I'm afraid I'm gonna step through into another dimension.
JERRY: Just go.
(George braces himself and walks through the detector.)
GEORGE: Heh he, I made it.
(Jerry walks through and the machine beeps.)
SECURITY GUARD: Empty your pockets please.
(Jerry empties his pockets and walks through again, the machine beeps again.)
SECURITY GUARD: Walk through again please.
(Jerry walks through, the machine beeps again.)
SECURITY GUARD: Are you sure you don't have any metal on you? Bracelets? Rings? Anklets?
JERRY: Anklets?
SECURITY GUARD: A lot of men wear anklets.
JERRY: Really?
SECURITY GUARD: Yeah.
OTHER SECURITY GUARD (to George): What do you have in your bag, sir?
GEORGE: My bag?
SECURITY GUARD: Step over here please.
JERRY: Over here?
OTHER SECURITY GUARD: Do you have a knife in the bag?
GEORGE: A knife?
OTHER SECURITY GUARD: Open the bag, please.
(George opens his bag, the other security guard begins rummaging.)
OTHER SECURITY GUARD: What's this?
GEORGE: Moisturizer?
OTHER SECURITY GUARD: For your wife?
GEORGE: No, I uh... I use it.
SECURITY GUARD: Spread your arms and legs please.
(The security guard begins waving a small beeping detector up and down Jerry's body.)
JERRY: (facing the lengthening line behind him) Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
OTHER SECURITY GUARD: Have a good trip.
SECURITY GUARD: Alright, go ahead.
JERRY: That's it?
SECURITY GUARD: That's it.
JERRY: Alright.
GEORGE: C'mon Jerry, let's go. What was that all about?
JERRY: I must have iron rich blood.
GEORGE: Here we go, LA.
JERRY: The Coast,
GEORGE: La-la Land. I got the window seat, right?
JERRY: Who said that?
GEORGE: I called it.
JERRY: Oh no.
GEORGE: What do you mean, oh no.
[Monologue, Jerry on stage.]
Seems to me that the closest thing we have to Royalty in America are the people that get to ride in those little carts through the airport. Don't you hate these things? They come out of nowhere; Beep Beep, cart people, look out, cart people! Look out! We all scurry out of the way like worthless peasants. Oooh! It's cart people! I hope we didn't slow you down. Wave to the cart people, Timmy, they're the best people in the world. Ya know, if you're too fat, slow and disoriented to get to your gate on time, you're not ready for air travel. The other people I hate are the people that get on to the moving walkway and then just stand there. Like it's a ride? Excuse me, there's no animated pirates or bears along the way here. Do your legs work at all?
[Stock photo of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Cut to a casting office. Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Oh ah, yeah, I'm here for the audition.
RECEPTIONIST: Which audition, the music video, the horror movie, the exercise tape or the infomercial?
KRAMER: Uh, let's see... well.
[Cut to a montage of Kramer in group auditions for the productions the receptionist mentioned.]
[Kramer and Chelsea, a woman he met in the horror movie audition, exit the
casting office.]
KRAMER: You scream good.
CHELSEA: You too.
[Kramer and Chelsea are seated at a restaurant table.]
CHELSEA: So, can I keep this treatment?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, I got 20 copies.
CHELSEA: 'Cause I can, uh, show it to my manager. He has connections with West German television money.
KRAMER: Really.
CHELSEA: Yeah, they're trying to put together a miniseries for me on Eva Braun. I mean think about it, is that a great idea? We know nothing about Eva Braun, only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.
KRAMER: Um-hm.
CHELSEA: What was it like having sex with Adolf Hitler? What do you wear in a bunker? What did her parents think of Hitler as a potential son-in-law? I mean it could just go on and on...
KRAMER: Wait wait, hold it, hold it. Look who's over there. Don't look, don't look! It's Fred Savage.
CHELSEA: Big deal.
KRAMER: He'd be perfect for my movie. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. (takes a deep breath) I gotta go over there, I gotta give him a copy of my treatment.
CHELSEA: Why are you breathing so hard?
KRAMER: Well, I'm just a little nervous. OK, I gotta relax. Phew. Wish me luck, huh?
(Kramer gets up and approaches Fred Savage who's sitting at a table nearby.)
KRAMER: Hey. Oh, did I frighten you? I'm not crazy. I mean, I may look weird, but I'm just like you, I'm just a regular guy just trying to make it in this business. You know I really like your work, the, uh...
FRED SAVAGE: Thank you.
KRAMER: Yeah, I can't remember the name of it.
FRED: Thanks.
KRAMER: Yeah, my mind's a blank, I'm sorta nervous, you know, uh...
FRED: That's ok. Relax, relax.
KRAMER: Ok, but I got this...
(Kramer lifts his leg and places his foot on a low table and the table collapses.)
KRAMER: Stupid table. You know, I'm not normally like this, usually I'm very cool and charming, I don't mean to bother you or anything but I think it's fate that you happened to be here at the same time as me.
FRED (a little frightened and backing away towards the door): Yeah, its fate, you know, can't avoid your fate.
KRAMER: I got this treatment I think you'll be great in.
FRED: Yeah.
KRAMER: So I'd like to give it to you.
FRED: Yeah, thank you, thanks a lot. Bye!
KRAMER: (bumping into a lamp) Alright, excuse me. Uh wait, wait.
(Fred takes the treatment and bolts for the door. After he leaves, Kramer gives the rest of the patrons a thumbs-up.)
[George and Jerry are in their hotel room. Jerry's on the telephone.]
JERRY: Yeah, Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R. Uh, I don't know, wavy? George, how would you describe Kramer's hair?
GEORGE: Curly.
JERRY: Wavy.
GEORGE: What'd you ask me for?
JERRY: Yeah, I'll hold on. Hey George, did you see a piece of paper I had on the nightstand here, like crumpled up, like a napkin?
GEORGE: Nope.
JERRY: 'Cause I had like three jokes on it, they were all perfectly worded just the way I wanted to have it. Can't find it. Hello?
GEORGE (from the bathroom): Hey, a shoe buffing machine!
JERRY: I don't know, 6-3, George, how tall is Kramer?
GEORGE: You got your own shampoo, conditioner, body lotion! Jerry, body
lotion!
JERRY: About 6-3.
GEORGE: Ooh, a shower cap!
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
JERRY: Coming.
(George walks to the door wearing a shower cap.)
LUPE: Hello. I have more towels.
GEORGE: Oh good, good, come in. Come in, welcome. I'm George. And this is Jerry, over there, on the phone, that's Jerry. And you are, um?
LUPE: Lupe.
GEORGE: Lupe. That's very nice, very nice. Listen, are you going to be making up the bed in the morning?
LUPE: Oh Yes.
GEORGE: Fine. Excellent. Could you do me a favor? Could you not tuck the blankets in? 'Cause I can't sleep all tucked in.
LUPE: Oh, yes, yes.
GEORGE: Yes, I like to just be able to take the blankets and swish them and swirl them, you know what I mean? You know, I don't like being all tucked in. I like to have a lot of room, you know I like to have my toes pointed up in the air. Just like to scrunch up the blankets.
LUPE: Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.
GEORGE: Exactly, you know what I'm talking about, right?
LUPE: Oh yees, It's too tight. (Gesturing towards Jerry) Him too?
GEORGE: Uh, Jerry, you want your blankets tucked in?
JERRY: Excuse me, what?
GEORGE: You want your blankets tucked in?
JERRY: What blankets?
GEORGE: When Lupe makes up the beds in the morning.
JERRY: I don't know, whatever they do.
LUPE: I tuck in? Yes?
JERRY: Tuck in, tuck in.
GEORGE: Alright, so that's one tuck and one no-tuck.
LUPE: Okay.
GEORGE: Yeah. One second sweetheart. Jerry, I really think it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.
JERRY: Excuse me, fine, you don't want me to tuck, put me down for a no-tuck.
GEORGE (to Lupe): Two no-tucks.
JERRY: Uh, hang on a second, You know what? Changed my mind, make it a tuck.
GEORGE: You just said you weren't tucking.
JERRY: I'm tucking! Hello? Hello? They hung up on me. They don't know where Kramer is anyway.
GEORGE: Alrighty, so. That's one tuck and one no-tuck. Got that?
JERRY: Excuse me, um, did you see a piece of paper on the nightstand here earlier today crumpled up like a napkin?
LUPE: Oh, yes, yes. I throw away when we clean the room.
JERRY: Oh, okay, thanks.
LUPE: Thank you.
GEORGE: Thank you.
LUPE: Bye-bye.
GEORGE: Alright, Lupe, bye-bye now.
LUPE: Bye.
GEORGE: Bye-bye.
(Lupe exits.)
JERRY: I can't believe she threw that out. I had like the perfect wording of a whole joke I was gonna do about the X-ray counter at the airport, I was gonna do it on the Tonight Show, now I can't remember it.
GEORGE: Well what did you want her to do, you left it on the night table.
JERRY: They're not supposed to just take everything and throw it out!
GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! It's not Lupe's fault, you shouldn't have left it out.
JERRY: Alright, just get your thing together and let's get out of here.
GEORGE: Alright, now. What mood am I in, what mood am I in?
[Cut to Jerry and George in the car, continuing their discussion.]
GEORGE: You shouldn't have tucked.
JERRY: I like it tucked.
GEORGE: Nobody tucks anymore.
(As Jerry drives past, Kramer exits a printing shop, gets into his car and drives off, spilling dozens of 8"x10" publicity photos. A police office notices this and picks up one of the photos.)
[Another murder scene. A police officer pulls a blanket over the body's head, but we catch a glimpse of the dead girl; it's Chelsea, Kramer's friend from the auditions. The same two Lieutenants as before are just arriving.]
OFFICER: Hey, Lieutenant.
LT. MARTEL:: Yeah.
OFFICER: This was found on her person.
LT. MARTEL:: On her person? What kind of expression is that?
OFFICER: I don't know, sir. Police lingo.
LT. MARTEL:: Oh yeah? What's your name, son.
OFFICER: Ross.
LT. MARTEL:: Ross. Do you see that person there, Ross?
OFFICER: Yes sir.
LT. MARTEL:: She's dead. Have you got that?
OFFICER: Yes sir.
LT. MARTEL:: Good. Now get out of here before you find yourself on transit patrol writing tickets to senior citizens with fake bus passes.
OFFICER: Yes sir.
(The Lt. examines the evidence. It's a title page that says "The Keys" A movie treatment by Kramer. The paper is torn so that the space where Kramer's first name was is missing.)
LT. MARTEL:: I think we just caught a break.
[Jerry and George are at the NBC studio.]
GEORGE: This is very exciting! You're on the Tonight Show, NBC, who else is on the show?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: Might meet a celebrity.
JERRY: I can't believe she threw out my napkin.
GEORGE: What are you worried about, you know it.
JERRY: You gonna be alright here?
GEORGE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, go. Go about your business, I'll just wander around.
JERRY: Alright, don't wander too far, I'll meet you back here in fifteen minutes.
GEORGE: Go, go, go, don't worry about it.
(Jerry leaves and Corbin Bernsen enters through a stage door. he stands near George, obviously waiting for someone.)
GEORGE: Hey. (pointing at him) Corbin Bernsen.
CORBIN BERNSEN: How ya doing?
GEORGE: Big fan! Big fan.
CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah.
GEORGE: Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah, yeah. I'm doing a movie during my hiatus.
GEORGE: Hey. You know, do I have a case for you guys to do on L.A. Law.
CORBIN BERNSEN: Really.
(Flash forward to the middle of George's 'pitch'.)
GEORGE: ...so mind you, at this point I'm only going out with her two or three weeks. So she goes out of town and she asks me to feed her cat. So at this time, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life and, uh, it slips my mind for a few days. Maybe a week. Not a week, five, six days.
CORBIN BERNSEN: Yeah yeah yeah. So what happened?
GEORGE: Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.
CORBIN BERNSEN: So you killed the cat.
GEORGE: That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?
(Corbin Bernsen just stares at George.)
(Flash forward, George is now talking with George Wendt in the same hallway.)
GEORGE: I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.
GEORGE WENDT: Oh, of course not.
GEORGE: But really, it's enough with the bar already.
GEORGE WENDT: Yeah, well.
GEORGE: Seriously, have they though about changing the setting?
GEORGE WENDT: Doubt it, I doubt it. Yeah.
GEORGE: Really? Because people do meet in places besides a bar, huh?
GEORGE WENDT: Well yeah, they do, heh heh.
GEORGE: What about a rec room? Huh? Or a community center.
GEORGE WENDT (checking his watch, obviously uncomfortable): Yeah, you oughta write one of those.
GEORGE: Yeah?
GEORGE WENDT: Yeah, I'll bring it up with the producers, I gotta... uh...
GEORGE: Fabulous, I'll think about that George, thank you!
(Jerry walks up as George Wendt leaves hastily.)
JERRY: How's it going?
GEORGE: Great! Great! I actually just had two meaningful intelligent conversations with Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt.
JERRY: Really?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, not fan talk, not gushing, you know? Actual conversation, I was incredibly articulate!
JERRY: You got toilet paper on your heel there.
(George looks down, Jerry walks away.)
[The Tonight Show, George is in the audience applauding.]
Announcer: It's the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Tonight Jay welcomes Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt and comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
(Quick cut to Corbin Bernsen, mid-interview.)
CORBIN BERNSEN: Oh yeah, yeah, people are always coming up to me trying to give me a great case for L.A. Law, just a few seconds ago, right here, right outside in the hallway this nut, some sick nut comes up to me and says he's supposed to watch this girl's cat while she's away out of town. Anyway he forgets to feed the cat, the cat dies, starves to death, he kills the cat, refuses to get her a new one, won't give her any money, won't pay her, and he wants Arnie Becker to represent him. Nice guy. Yeah, that'd make a *great* case for L.A. Law. Thanks a lot.
(Quick shot of the audience, everyone is laughing besides George.)
[Cut to a police station. Helena is being questioned by Lt. Martel.]
HELENA: He's a very handsome man. Passionate, intense, but troubled, strange. I think he may be in love with me. Of course there's nothing abnormal about that, I have many suitors.
[Cut back to the Tonight Show, George Wendt, mid-interview.]
GEORGE WENDT: It's funny, 'cause even after all these years, we still get people giving us advice, how to improve the show. Actually, a few moments ago I ran into a nut back there, he said, you know, that maybe we should think about, you know, not doing the show in a bar.
(Another quick shot of the audience, again everyone is laughing besides George.)
[Cut back to the police station. One of the kids from the van Kramer hitched a ride to LA in (see "The Keys") known only as 'The Freak' is being questioned by the Lt.]
THE FREAK: So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer, dude. You ever killed a man before?" And he said, "What do you think, Junior? These hands have been soaking in Ivory liquid?
[Cut back to the Tonight Show, Corbin Bernsen and George Wendt are talking between takes.]
GEORGE WENDT: The guy you talked to, what did he look like?
CORBIN BERNSEN: Short little bald guy with glasses.
GEORGE WENDT: Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy I talked to.
CORBIN BERNSEN: It never ends, does it?
(Cut to Jerry, on stage, doing his routine.)
JERRY: So I'm going through the airport and I have to put my bag on that little uh, uh, the uh, that uh, the conveyor belt.
(Quick shot of the audience, nobody is laughing.)
(Quick shot of an extremely uncomfortable Jerry.)
[Cut back to the police station. The Lt. is on the phone.]
LT. MARTEL: Issue an arrest warrant, put out an APB. Let's pick up this, uh, Kramer.
[George and Jerry are leaving the Tonight Show set]
JERRY: I was terrible.
GEORGE: What are you, crazy? You were fine.
JERRY: Nah, did you hear the end? I couldn't remember what I was trying to say, that whole thing about the, uh...
GEORGE: Conveyor belt.
JERRY: Yeah. Because she threw out my napkin.
GEORGE: I can't believe, you're blaming Lupe?
JERRY: Yes, Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.
(George and Jerry walk past a TV and stop as a special report is being broadcast.)
TV NEWSCASTER: Our top story tonight, there has been a break in the so called 'Smog Stranglings'. Police have just released a photo of the suspect being sought in connection with the slayings. He is known only as "Kramer".
(George and Jerry stare at each other in disbelief.)
Closing monologue.
Talk show hosts never seem to have any idea how much time is left in the show. You know, they're always looking off camera, "Do we have time? Are we out of time? How we doin' on time? Anybody know what the time is? What's the time? Check the time?" You never see Magnum P.I. go, "Should I strangle this guy or are we gonna take a break here? Can you stay for another beating? I'll tell you what, I'll bop him in the head, we'll do a commercial, we'll come back, I'll drive in the car real fast, stay with us."
[OPENING MONOLOGUE]
There are many different job in the police. It seems to me, that the chalk outline guy is one of the better jobs that you can get. You know it's not dangerous, the criminals are long gone, that seems like a good one. I don't know who they are, I guess they're people who wanted to be a sketch artists, but they couldn't draw too well..."listen Johnson, forget the sketches. Do you think if we left a dead body right there on the sidewalk, you could manage to trace around it? Could you do that?". I don't even know how it helps to solve the crime? You know, they look at the thing on the ground..."aah his arm was like that when he hit the pavement. That means the killer must've been Jim."
[OPENING SCENE]
(GEORGE AND JERRY ARE IN A CAR. GEORGE IS GRABBING JERRY'S ARM)
GEORGE: He's on the lamb(?), he's on the loose!
JERRY: Would you let go of my arm?! I'm trying to drive, you're getting us both killed!
GEORGE: What are we supposed to do? What do you do on a situation like this? Should we call a lawyer, should we call the police?
JERRY: Obviously we're gonna call the police and tell that he's not the guy.
GEORGE: Hope he's not the guy.
JERRY: Couldn't be the guy...nah.
GEORGE: God, I'm starved, I'm weak from hunger.
JERRY: How can you think of food at the time like this?
GEORGE: Time like what? I'm hungry. My stomach doesn't know that Kramer's wanted.
JERRY: I told you to have breakfast, you should've had breakfast!
GEORGE: I couldn't have breakfast, it was lunchtime! The three hour time difference threw me. I wanted a tuna fish sandwich, they wouldn't serve me tuna fish sandwich, because they were only serving breakfast.
JERRY: You should've had some eggs.
GEORGE: For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?
JERRY: Have you ever heard of egg salad?
GEORGE: Why didn't you say something then?
JERRY: I've gotta to tell you about existence of egg salad?
GEORGE: I need food, Jerry. I feel faint, I'm getting light headed.
JERRY: I've gotta call the police, there's a pay phone over there.
GEORGE: Pay phone in L.A., look it's a miracle.
[CUT TO KRAMER SINGING IN A SHOWER FOLLOWED BY A FALLING SOUND]
[BACK TO GEORGE AND JERRY ON THE STREET]
JERRY: I don't have any change. You've got any change?
GEORGE: No, I don't have any change. I never carry change.
JERRY: Well, we need change and all I have is twenties.
GEORGE: I have a ten.
JERRY: So, break it.
GEORGE: I hate asking for change. They always make a face. Like I'm asking them to donate a kidney.
JERRY: So, buy something.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: I don't know, some mints or TicTacs.
GEORGE: Breath problem?
JERRY: No, I just want some change.
GEORGE: Tell me.
JERRY: Your breath is fine. It's delightful, it's delicious.
GEORGE: You know, I haven't eaten anything.
JERRY: I just wanna call the police!
GEORGE: Why don't you just call 911?
JERRY: But is this an emergency?
GEORGE: Of course it is.
JERRY: How is this an emergency?
GEORGE: Your friend is been accused of being a serial killer. I think that qualifies.
JERRY: All right, I'll call 911. Think he did it? Could've he done it? Couldn't done it? How could've he done it? Couldn't be? Could it? Hello 911? How are you? I'm sorry it was just a reflex...I know it's an emergency number...it is an emergency...my friend is being accused of being a smog strangler and I know he didn't do it...they're putting me trough to the detective in charge of the investigation...what is my name? Who am I? I'm eh...George Costanza...
GEORGE: What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Why are you using my name?!
JERRY: Oh, don't be a baby! What are you scared of?
GEORGE: What am I scared of? I'm scared of the same thing that you are, everything! Why don't you just use your own name?
JERRY: Your name is a good name, Costanza. Sounds like it's stands for something, they'll believe us.
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Sure.
GEORGE: You think so?
JERRY: Oh yeah. Yes I have some very important information regarding the smog strangler. (George leans close) would you suck a mint or something. Can I come right now? I suppose, where are you located? Where is that? I don't know where we are. Where are we?
GEORGE: I don't know.
JERRY: We don't know. He says ask somebody, ask that guy.
GEORGE: Excuse me, where are we?
MAN: Earth.
JERRY: Hey, you know I'm on the phone with the police! Some guy just gave me a wise answer. Ask that woman.
GEORGE: Excuse me Ms. which street are we on?
WOMAN: I don't know.
GEORGE: You don't know?
WOMAN: I don't know.
GEORGE: How come you don't know what street are you on?
WOMAN: You don't know.
JERRY: George, it says it here on the phone. It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard. Aha, ok...do we know where the 101 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 170 is? (George shakes his head) No...do we know where 134 is? (George just looks at Jerry) No. Aha, ok. (Jerry hangs up) He's gonna send a black and white to pick us up.
(Police car rolls by the sidewalk and stops. The police listens their conversation.)
GEORGE: Black and white?
JERRY: A cop car.
GEORGE: Why didn't you just say that?
JERRY: I thought it sounded kind of cool.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
JERRY: Oh, you are? I guaranty you, Lupe is going to tuck your covers in.
GEORGE: I'll bet you, how much?
JERRY: Her tip.
GEORGE: You've got a bet.
JERRY: Ok.
GEORGE: How much do you tip a chamber maid?
POLICE: Which one of you is Costanza?
(Jerry and George point at each other.)
POLICE: Get in.
GEORGE: Hi, how are you guys? Listen, does either one of you have like a mint or piece of gum or...
[KRAMER IS SHAVING. HE SNEEZES AND GETS SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR]
[BACK TO THE POLICE CAR WITH JERRY, GEORGE AND TWO COPS]
GEORGE: Jerry, would you do me a favor, close the window.
(JERRY SEARCHES FOR THE HANDLE, BUT CAN'T FIND ONE)
JERRY: Hey, get out of here...hey officer, he's fooling around back here.
COP: Cut it up back there.
GEORGE: He started it.
JERRY: I did not. You guys gonna go through some red lights?
COP: I don't think so.
JERRY: But you could?
COP: Oh yeah, of course we could. We can do anything we want.
COP 2: We could drive on the wrong side of the road.
COP: Yeah, we do that all the time. You should see the looks on people's faces.
COP 2: Shoot people...
GEORGE: You guys ever shot anybody?
COPS: No...
GEORGE: Hey, can I flip on the siren?
JERRY: Why are you bothering them for?
GEORGE: I'm just asking, all they have to do is say no.
COP: Yeah, go ahead.
(GEORGE TRIES THE SIREN)
GEORGE: Wohoo, check it out.
JERRY: Can I try it?
COP: Yeah, go ahead, hurry up.
(JERRY TRIES THE SIREN)
JERRY: Scared the hell out of that guy.
GEORGE: You know what I never understood? Why did they change the siren noise? When I was a kid it was always "waaaa, waaaa", you know now it "woo-woo-woo-woo-woo". Why did they do that, did they do some research? Did they find that woo-woo was more effective than waa?
JERRY: Yeah, what about those English sirens, you know...eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
JERRY and GEORGE: Eee-aaa-eee-aaa-eee-aaa...
COP: Hey!
[KRAMER IS COMBING HIS HAIR. TRYING TO GET THE COMB THROUGH.]
KRAMER: I'm dizzy.
[BACK TO THE POLICE CAR]
JERRY: Nice shotgun.
COP: Thanks.
JERRY: Clean as a whistle.
GEORGE: You could eat of that shotgun.
JERRY: What is that, a 12 gauge?
COP: Yeah.
JERRY: 12 gauge. Seems to be the most popular gauge.
GEORGE: My favorite.
JERRY: Mine too, love the 12 gauge.
GEORGE: Makes the 11 gauge look like a cap pistol.
COP: What do got over there?
COP 2: I don't know.
COP: Looks like a possible 5-19.
JERRY: 5-19? What's a 5-19?
GEORGE: Where?
COP 2: Think so?
COP: Looks like it.
JERRY: I can't believe this. A 5-19?
GEORGE: Where, where? I can't see.
COP: This is car 23, we have a possible 5-19 in progress, over.
COP 2: All right, let's pull over and check it out.
JERRY: Pull over? You can't pull over.
GEORGE: What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?
JERRY: Pull over? The lieutenant is waiting to see us.
GEORGE: Hey hey hey, we're in a rush here.
JERRY: We have an appointment!
GEORGE: What are you doing?!
JERRY: Great.
(COPS GO TO ARREST A GUY FOR TRYING TO STEAL A CAR)
GEORGE: There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm cookies up there.
JERRY: Which flavor?
GEORGE: Milano.
JERRY: Cops eating Milanos. What crazy town is this?
GEORGE: Should I take some?
JERRY: I think that's a 5-19.
GEORGE: I'm starving...
(GEORGE REACHES FOR THE COOKIES AND THE COPS SLAM A GUY ON THE HOOD AND GEORGE BACKS AWAY)
JERRY: They're busting this guy.
GEORGE: They're cuffing him.
JERRY: I can't believe this.
(GEORGE GET CLOSER TO JERRY AND THEY THROW THE GUY NEXT TO GEORGE)
[MIDDLE MONOLOGUE]
I can't believe that cops still have to read that whole "you have the right to remain silence"-speech to every criminal they arrest. I mean is there anybody who doesn't know that by now? Can't they just go "Freeze, you're under arrest. You've ever seen Baretta? Yeah, good, get in the car."
[BACK TO POLICE CAR]
GEORGE: Hi.
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.
GEORGE: George, how you doing?
(GEORGE OFFERS HIS HAND, BUT THE GUY IS IN CUFFS)
GUY: What did you do?
GEORGE: Nothing.
JERRY: Nothing.
GUY: Oh yeah right, me neither. Hey I didn't do nothing!
COP: Shut up.
JERRY: Hot out.
GUY: Brutal.
GEORGE: What do you tip a chamber maid.
GUY: I don't know, five bucks a night.
JERRY: No, a dollar, two tops.
GUY: Hey, you guys aren't cuffed. What are you, narks?
GEORGE: Narks?
JERRY: Imagine, us narks?
GEORGE: No no no, you know actually we are friends of a serial killer.
GUY: Really? Well, that's very nice.
GEORGE: Oh, thank you.
JERRY: Suspected serial killer, he didn't actually do it.
GEORGE: Yeah well, we don't think.
JERRY: We're pretty sure.
GUY: A dollar a night?
JERRY: Yeah, that's a good tip!
GUY: That stinks!
JERRY: I read it in Ann Landers.
GUY: Oh, Ann Landers sucks!
COP 2: Hey, shut it up back there.
POLICE RADIO: Attention all units, attention all units, all units code 3. All units in the area, code 3 in progress, 1648 North Bartholis, units required for assistance in apprehension of 702.
COP: That's smog strangler.
JERRY: Kramer.
COP 2: Got him. Let's go.
(POLICE CAR COMES TO THE SCENE. JERRY OPENS THE BACK DOOR THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THEY GO AFTER THE COPS)
JERRY: I wanna see what's happening.
GEORGE: I don't know why I'm doing this.
LT MARTEL KNOCKS ON A DOOR AND KRAMER OPENS
KRAMER: Jerry, George!
LT. MARTEL: You are under arrest in first degree murder and death of Ms Chelsea Lang.
(THE CAR THIEVE GUY RUNS AWAY FROM THE DOOR THAT JERRY AND GEORGE LEFT OPEN)
[KRAMER IS RUSHED THROUGH A GROUP OF PRESS]
REPORTERS: Why did you do it? What possessed you?
KRAMER: I don't know...
[COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES CENTRAL JAIL]
(JERRY AND GEORGE ARE VISITING KRAMER)
KRAMER: Hey, how are you doing? Jerry! George!
JERRY: We're doing fine. How are you?
KRAMER: What me? Fabulous, just fabulous. I've got a lot of auditions, a lot of call backs and I've got a lot of interest for my movie treatment. I'm in development, I'm in developed vehicles. And there's a lot of energy here, man. You know, the vibe, it's powerful. I'm just swept up at it. Yeah, I'm a player.
GEORGE: A player?
KRAMER: Yeah, a player...
JERRY: Kramer, do you realize what's going on here? Do you know why you're here?
KRAMER: What? What this? I'll be out of here in couple of hours. Hey, guess who I met today? Rick Savage, oh nice kid, really good kid. You know, we're talking about doing a project together.
JERRY: Kramer, you've been arrested as a serial killer!
KRAMER: So? I'm innocent! I mean you guys believe that I'm innocent, don't you? Jerry? George?
JERRY: Well, yeah...sure.
POLICE: Kramer, let's go. The Lieutenant wants to see you.
KRAMER: Ok, yeah. All right look, I'll be out of here by noon. Maybe we'll have lunch together, huh?
(KRAMER GOES WITH THE POLICE OFFICER, BUT ASKS IF HE COULD SAY JUST ONE MORE THING)
KRAMER: Help me!! Help me!
(OFFICER DRAGS KRAMER AWAY)
[KRAMER IS BEEN INTERROGATED BY LT. MARTEL]
KRAMER: I didn't kill anyone, I swear! I swear to God!
LT. MARTEL: Don't you ever swear to my God, Kramer. My God is the god who protects the innocent and punishes the evil scum like you, have you got that?
KRAMER: You're making a big mistake.
LT. MARTEL: No! You have made the mistake, Kramer. Sickies like you always do. The only difference is that this time you're gonna pay.
KRAMER: What?
LT. MARTEL: Now you might beat the gas chamber Kramer, but as long as I have got a breath in my body you will never ever see the light of day again.
KRAMER: Wow wow wow wow, you've got the wrong man!! It wasn't me!
LT. MARTEL: Oh yeah, right. Maybe it was one of your other personalities huh, the wise guy, the little kid, the bellhop, the ball player, maybe the door to door vacuum cleaner salesman, but not you right? No, you wouldn't hurt a fly. You just couldn't help yourself, could you Kramer? You saw life brimming brightly with optimism and verve and you just had to snuff it out.
KRAMER: Ok, can I just talk to somebody? Can I just explain...
LT. MARTEL: I'm not interested in your explanations, Kramer! Sure, I bet you've got a million of 'em. Maybe your mother didn't love you enough, maybe the teacher didn't call on you in school when you had your little hand raised, maybe the pervert in the park had a present in his pants, huh? Well, I've got another theory you're a weed.
KRAMER: No...
LT. MARTEL: Society is filled with them. They're choking the life out of the all pretty flowers.
(KRAMER SOBS)
LT. MARTEL: You see something even remotely pretty and you have to choke the life out if it, don't you Kramer?
(KRAMER CRIES)
LT. MARTEL: You killed all the pretty flowers, didn't you Kramer? You killed the pretty little flowers, didn't you? You dirty, filthy, stinky weed! Didn't you?
(PHONE RINGS)
OFFICER: Lieutenant, it's for you.
LT. MARTEL: Martel...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah.
(KRAMER KEEPS CRYING)
OFFICER: What it is, Lieutenant?
LT. MARTEL: Let him go.
OFFICER: What, but Lieutenant?
LT. MARTEL: You heard me, let him go. They just found another body at the Laurel Canyon. Go on Kramer, get out of my sight.
KRAMER: Hey, how did you know about the guy in the park?
LT. MARTEL: I said beat it!
[JERRY AND GEORGE ARE WAITING OUTSIDE OF THE JAIL]
(KRAMER WALKS OUT)
KRAMER: Hahaa!
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: What happened?
KRAMER: Somebody got killed while they had me in custody.
JERRY: Really? Did you hear that? Somebody else was killed!
GEORGE: You're kidding? Somebody else got killed?
JERRY: While you were in jail. So you're free.
KRAMER: Yes, I'm free. (singing) 'cause the murderer struck again!
(THEY ALL DANCE A FEW STEPS AND THEN AS A POLICE GOES BY THEY LEAVE QUIETLY)
[KRAMER, JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HILLS OF L.A.]
JERRY: So Kramer, what are you going to do?
KRAMER: Do? Do? Hey, I'm doing what I do. You know, I've always done what I do. I'm doing what I do, way I've always done and the way I'll always do it.
GEORGE: Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
KRAMER: What do you want me to say? That the things haven't worked out the way that I planned? That I'm struggling, barely able to keep my head above water? That L.A. is a cold place even in the middle of the summer? That it's a lonely place even when your stuck in traffic at the Hollywood Freeway? That I'm no better than a screenwriter driving a cab, a starlet turning tricks, a producer in a house he can't afford? Is that what you want me to say?
GEORGE: I'd like to hear that.
JERRY: Yeah...
KRAMER: Well, I'm not saying that! You know, things are going pretty well for me here. I met a girl...
JERRY: Kramer, she was murdered!
KRAMER: Yeah, well I wasn't looking for a long term relationship. I was on TV.
GEORGE: As a suspect in a serial killing.
KRAMER: Ok, yeah, you guys got to put a negative spin on everything.
GEORGE: What did they put on this tuna? Tastes like a dill, I think it's a dill.
JERRY: So you're not gonna come back to New York with us?
KRAMER: No no I'm not ready, things are starting to happen.
GEORGE: Taste this, is this a dill?
JERRY: No, it's tarragon. Hey Kramer, I'm sorry about that whole fight we had about you having my apartment keys and everything.
KRAMER: Ok, it's forgotten.
GEORGE: Tarragon? Oh, you're crazy.
JERRY: Well, take it easy.
KRAMER: Yeah, ok.
GEORGE: Yeah, take care. Stay in touch.
KRAMER: Hey hey, whoa come on give me a hug...
JERRY: Oh, no...
GEORGE: No, you're crushing my sandwich.
[JERRY AND GEORGE AT THE HOTEL. GEORGE IS KICKING THE TUCKED COVERS.]
JERRY: Yeah, it's so nice when it happens to you.
[BACK TO JERRY'S APARTMENT. GEORGE AND JERRY ARE WATCHING TV. ]
GEORGE: Mint?
JERRY: No thanks.
GEORGE: I've got to tell you, I'm really disappointed in Lupe.
JERRY: It's been three days already, forget about Lupe.
GEORGE: Do you think she gets to take any of those little bars of soap home?
JERRY: No, I don't.
GEORGE: You would think that at the end of the week when they hand out the checks, throw in a few soaps.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe they should throw in a couple of lamps too.
GEORGE: I'll tell you something, if I'd own a company, my employees would love me. They'd have huge pictures of me up on the walls and in their home, like Lenin.
JERRY: How much did you wound up tipping her?
GEORGE: Oh my God, I forgot!
JERRY: Well, communism didn't work.
(KRAMER WALKS IN)
KRAMER: Hey!
(KRAMER GOES TO THE FRIDGE)
KRAMER: Any mustard? This is empty.
JERRY: Yeah, there's a new one in there.
KRAMER: No no, I don't like this one. It's too yellow. Any pickles?
JERRY: Help yourself.
KRAMER: Yeah, all right.
GEORGE: Kramer, what are you doing here?
KRAMER: Getting something to eat.
JERRY: Kramer, here!
(JERRY THROWS THE APARTMENT KEYS TO KRAMER. KRAMER WALKS OUT AND COMES BACK WITH HIS KEYS. HE THROWS THEM TO THE TABLE KNOCKING JERRY'S SODA.)
[ACTION NEWS. KEITH MORRISON.]
Newscaster: Authorities exposed today, that the latest suspect in the smog strangling was apprehended this week on an unrelated charge, but somehow managed to escape from the police car, in which he was being held. Tobias Lehigh Nagy, who is also wanted in connection with a series of unrelated slains in the North West is still at large, his whereabouts unknown. He's described as 5'5" bald and reputedly a very generous tipper.
[CLOSING MONOLOGUE]
The thing about L.A. to me, that kind of threw me, was when they have these smog alerts out there and they actually recommend that people stay indoors during the smog alert. Now, maybe I'm way off, but don't you think, wouldn't you assume, that the air in the house pretty much comes from the air in the city where the house is? I mean what do they think, that we live in a jar with couple of holes punched in the top? What the hell is going on out there? It's very strange, do you realize that it's now possible for parents to say to their children "All right kids, I want you in the house and get some fresh air! Summer vacation, everybody indoors."
[The Improv Bar]
GEORGE: What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?
JERRY: Everything with you comes down to toilet paper.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: That's always the first question with you. Why is that always your focus?
GEORGE: All right, so what did they do?
JERRY: I don't know. Maybe they gave out fig leaf clumps to all the soldiers.
GEORGE: Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.
JERRY: Maybe they should have a toilet paper museum. Would you like that? So we could see all the toilet paper advancements down through the ages. Toilet paper of the Crusades, the development of the perforation, the first six-pack . . .
STU: Excuse me, Jerry? I'm Stu Chermak. I'm with NBC.
JERRY: Hi.
STU: Could we speak for a few moments?
JERRY: Sure.
JAY: Hi, Jay Crespi.
JERRY: Hello.
GEORGE: Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I?
JAY: That's right.
GEORGE: I'm unbelievable at spelling last names. Give me a last name.
JAY: Mm, I'm not-
JERRY: George-
GEORGE: (backing off) Huh? All right, fine.
STU: First of all, that was a terrific show.
JERRY: Oh thank you very much.
STU: And basically, I just wanted to let you know that we've been discussing you at some of our meetings and we'd be very interested in doing something.
JERRY: Really? Wow.
STU: So, if you have any idea for like a TV show for yourself, well, we'd just love to talk about it.
JERRY: I'd be very interested in something like that.
STU: Well, here, uh, why don't you give us a call and maybe we can develop a series.
(They start to exit.)
JERRY: Okay. Great. Thanks.
STU: It was very nice meeting you.
JERRY: Thank you.
JAY: Nice meeting you.
JERRY: Nice meeting you.
(George returns)
GEORGE: What was that all about?
JERRY: They said they were interested in me.
GEORGE: For what?
JERRY: You know, a TV show.
GEORGE: Your own show?
JERRY: Yeah, I guess so.
GEORGE: They want you to do a TV show?
JERRY: Well, they want me to come up with an idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.
GEORGE: Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.
JERRY: Why should I care if my son's into gymnastics?
GEORGE: Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.
JERRY: But gymnastics is not for everybody.
GEORGE: I know, but he's your son.
JERRY: So what?
GEORGE: All right, forget that idea, it's not for you....Okay, okay, I got it. You run an antique store.
JERRY: Yeah and...?
GEORGE: And people come in the store and you get involved in their lives.
JERRY: What person who runs an antique store gets involved in people's lives?
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: So someone comes in to buy an old lamp and all of a sudden I'm getting them out of a jam? I could see if I was a pharmacist because a pharmacist knows what's wrong with everybody that comes in.
GEORGE: I know, but antiques are very popular right now.
JERRY: No they're not, they used to be.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, like you know.
JERRY: Oh like you do.
[Jerry's Apartment]
KRAMER: ...And you're the manager of the circus.
JERRY: A circus?
KRAMER: Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.
JERRY: I don't think so.
KRAMER: Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.
JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it.
KRAMER: Why not?
JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.
KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."
NEWMAN:Kramer.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
NEWMAN: Come on lets go. I got the helmet. Lets get the radar detector.
KRAMER: All right I'll be back in a second. You guys coming to my party? (exits)
JERRY AND NEWMAN: Yeah, sure.
JERRY: What's this all about?
NEWMAN: We're making a trade. I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet - he's giving me his radar detector.
JERRY: I didn't know you had a motorctcle.
NEWMAN: Well my girlfriend had one.
JERRY: You have a girlfriend?
NEWMAN: I HAD a girlfriend and she was pretty wild.
JERRY: I never remember you with a girl.
NEWMAN: Nevertheless, ...
JERRY: This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer. You know a radar detector is worth much more than that helmet. I think you're cheating him.
NEWMAN: Don't say anything.
JERRY: All right.
(Kramer enters)
JERRY: You know you're getting gypped over here.
KRAMER: Really, Ah,
NEWMAN: We had a deal. Are you reneging out of the deal? Are you reneging? That's a renege.
KRAMER: Oh, stop saying 'reneging".
NEWMAN: Well you're reneging.
KRAMER: I, Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.
(they try to exchange items but won't let go)
NEWMAN: All right give it to me. let go ...
KRAMER: You let go - come on ...(they fight over the items)
JERRY: Gimme that - just gimme that. Here. Idiots!
NEWMAN: Thanks buddy. So long he he ...(exits)
JERRY: Does that thing work?
KRAMER: Nah.
[At Monks]
(Jerry and George enter.)
JERRY: ... I just got a postcard from Elaine?
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah, they're in London now. They'll be back in a few weeks.
GEORGE: I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.
GEORGE: So, what's happening with the TV show? You come up with anything?
JERRY: No, nothing.
GEORGE: Why don't they have salsa on the table?
JERRY: What do you need salsa for?
GEORGE: Salsa is now the number one condiment in America.
JERRY: You know why? Because people like to say "salsa." "Excuse me, do you have salsa?" "We need more salsa." "Where is the salsa? No salsa?"
GEORGE: You know it must be impossible for a Spanish person to order seltzer and not get salsa. (Angry) "I wanted seltzer, not salsa."
JERRY: "Don't you know the difference between seltzer and salsa?? You have the seltezer after the salsa!"
GEORGE: See, this should be a show. This is the show.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: This. Just talking.
JERRY: (dismissing) Yeah, right.
GEORGE: I'm really serious. I think that's a good idea.
JERRY: Just talking? Well what's the show about?
GEORGE: It's about nothing.
JERRY: No story?
GEORGE: No forget the story.
JERRY: You've got to have a story.
GEORGE: Who says you gotta have a story? Remember when we were waiting for, for that table in that Chinese restaurant that time? That could be a TV show.
JERRY: And who is on the show? Who are the characters?
GEORGE: I could be a character.
JERRY: You?
GEORGE: Yeah. You could base a character on me.
JERRY: So, on the show, there's a character named George Costanza?
GEORGE: Yeah. There's something wrong with that? I'm a character. People are always saying to me, "You know you're a quite a character."
JERRY: And who else is on the show?
GEORGE: Elaine could be a character. Kramer..
JERRY: Now he's a character. (Pause) So everybody I know is a character on the show.
GEORGE: Right.
JERRY: And it's about nothing?
GEORGE: Absolutely nothing.
JERRY: So you're saying, I go in to NBC, and tell them I got this idea for a show about nothing.
GEORGE: We go into NBC.
JERRY: "We"? Since when are you a writer?
GEORGE: (Scoffs) Writer. We're talking about a sit-com.
JERRY: You want to go with me to NBC?
GEORGE: Yeah. I think we really go something here.
JERRY: What do we got?
GEORGE: An idea.
JERRY: What idea?
GEORGE: An idea for the show.
JERRY: I still don't know what the idea is.
GEORGE: It's about nothing.
JERRY: Right.
GEORGE: Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.
JERRY: So, we go into NBC, we tell them we've got an idea for a show about nothing.
GEORGE: Exactly.
JERRY: They say, "What's your show about?" I say, "Nothing."
GEORGE: There you go.
(A moment passes)
JERRY: (Nodding) I think you may have something there.
[Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's explaining George's idea to Kramer)
JERRY: So, the show would be about my real life. And one of the characters would be based on you.
KRAMER: (Thinks) No, I don't think so.
JERRY: What do you mean you don't think so?
KRAMER: I don't like it.
JERRY: I don't understand. What don't you like about it?
KRAMER: I don't like the idea of a character based on me.
JERRY: Why not?
KRAMER: well it just doesn't sit well.
JERRY: You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.
KRAMER: That's your problem, buddy.
JERRY: I don't understand what the big deal is.
KRAMER: Hey, I'll tell you what - you can do it on one condition.
JERRY: Whatever you want.
KRAMER: I get to play Kramer.
JERRY: You can't play Kramer.
KRAMER: I am Kramer.
JERRY: But you can't act.
KRAMER: Phew!
(Newman enters)
JERRY: Okay, fine. We'll use Newman.
KRAMER: Newman?
NEWMAN:Use me for what?
JERRY: Nothin' What do you want?
NEWMAN:Well, you'll never guess what happened to me today. I was uh, driving ( Jerry and Kramer turn away) home on the palisades parkway when I looked in the rear view mirror and what did I see? The fuzz. And it's funny because my new radar detector was on. I didn't hear a thing. Isn't that strange?
KRAMER: Yeah. That's strange.
NEWMAN:A radar detector, as I understand it, DETECTS RADAR! WITH A SERIES OF BEEPS AND FLASHING LIGHTS. But oddly, for some reason I didn't hear a thing except for the sound of a police siren.
KRAMER: That's queer uh?
NEWMAN: I WANT MY HELMET BACK! GIVE ME BACK MY HELMET AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT TICKET.
KRAMER: Yeah, you better think again Mojumbo.
NEWMAN:You gave me a defective detector. ... Jerry?
JERRY: Buyer beware.
NEWMAN:Are you going to give me back that helmet or not?
KRAMER: No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
NEWMAN:No, but there's karma, Kramer.
JERRY: Karma Kramer?
NEWMAN:And one more thing. I'm not coming to your party. (exits)
[NBC reception area]
(Jerry and George are waiting)
JERRY: (To himself) Salsa, seltzer. Hey, excuse me, you got any salsa? No, not selzer, salsa. (George doesn't react) What's the matter?
GEORGE: (Nervous) Nothing.
JERRY: You sure? You look a little pale.
GEORGE: No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm very good.
JERRY: What, are you nervous?
GEORGE: No, not nervous. I'm good, very good. (A beat, then he snaps) I can't do this! Can't do this!
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: I can't do this! I can't do it. I have tried. I'm here. It's impossible.
JERRY: This was your idea!
GEORGE: What idea? I just said something. I didn't know you were going to listen to me.
JERRY: Dont' worry about it. They're just TV executives.
GEORGE: They're men with jobs, Jerry! They wear suits and ties. They're married, they have secretaries.
JERRY: I told you not to come.
GEORGE: I need some water. I gotta get some water.
JERRY: They'll give us water in there.
GEORGE: Really? That's pretty good.
(Jerry looks into hallway)
JERRY: Oh God, it's Joe Devola.
GEORGE: Who?
JERRY: This guy's a writer, he's a total nut. I think he goes to the same shrink as Elaine.
JERRY: Oh God he saw me.
DEVOLA: Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Hey Joe! HOW YOU DOING?
DEVOLA: You're under no obligation to shake my hand.
JERRY: Oh, no, Just a custom. Uh, THAT'S MY FRIEND GEORGE. YOU LOOK GOOD.
DEVOLA: Why shouldn't I look good?
JERRY: Oh, no reason. You're into karate right?
DEVOLA: You want to hit me?
JERRY: What are you doing here?
DEVOLA: I dreopped a script off.
JERRY: AH, GOOD FOR YOU.
(they stare at each other)
JERRY: Well, ...
DEVOLA: You don't have to say anything.
JERRY: No, Uh, hey I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
DEVOLA: Why?
JERRY: Kramer's party.
DEVOLA: Kramer's ... having ... a ... party?
JERRY: No, no, he's not having a party. He's doing something. I don't know what it is. It's nothing. He's not doing anything.
DEVOLA: Gee, I thought Kramer and I were very close friends.
JERRY: No, I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are very close friends. Very close.
(Crazy Joe leaves)
JERRY: Give my best to Hinckley.
GEORGE: What was that?
JERRY: I can't believe what I just did. I didn't know kramer didn't invite him. I better call Kramer, ...
(before he can dial)
RECEPTIONIST: They're ready for you.
GEORGE: Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?
JERRY: Relax. Who are they?
GEORGE: Yeah, they're not better than me.
JERRY: Course not.
GEORGE: Who are they?
JERRY: They're nobody.
GEORGE: What about me?
JERRY: What about you?
GEORGE: Why them? Why not me?
JERRY: Why not you?
GEORGE: I'm as good as them.
JERRY: Better.
GEORGE: You really think so?
JERRY: No.
(The door opens, and, from Jerry and George's point of view, four executives stand up)
[NBC president's office]
(Stu Chermak, Susan Ross, Jay Crespi, and Russell Dalrymple, the head of the network, are all talking with Jerry and George)
STU: (To Jerry, laughing about one of his bits) The bit, the bit I really liked what were the parakeet flew into the mirror. Now that's funny.
GEORGE: The parakeet in the mirror. That's a good one, Stu.
JERRY: Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
RUSSELL: What about you, George? Have you written anything we might know?
GEORGE: (Quickly making it up) Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, "La Cocina." ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.
JERRY: Oh, it was very funny. There was one great scene with the chef - what was his name?
GEORGE: Pepe.
JERRY: Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.
SUSAN: Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?
GEORGE: No, no, he mimed it. That's what was so funny about it.
RUSSELL: So, what have you two come up with?
JERRY: Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-
GEORGE: (Interrupting) May I?
JERRY: Go ahead.
GEORGE: I think I can sum up the show for you with one word: NOTHING.
RUSSELL: Nothing?
GEORGE: (Smiling) Nothing.
RUSSELL: (Unimpressed) What does that mean?
GEORGE: The show is about nothing.
JERRY: (To George) Well, it's not about nothing.
GEORGE: (To Jerry) No, it's about nothing.
JERRY: Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.
(Jerry and George glare at each other. The receptionist enters)
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Dalrymple, your niece is on the phone.
RUSSELL: I'll call back.
(Receptionist leaves)
GEORGE:(Attempting to spell his last name) D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L?
RUSSELL: (Obviously dislikes George) Not even close.
GEORGE: Is it with a "y"?
RUSSELL: No.
SUSAN: What's the premise?
JERRY: ..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.
GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens on the show. You see, it's just like life. You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go shopping.
RUSSELL: You read? You read on the show?
JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.
RUSSELL: All right, tell me, tell me about the stories. What kind of stories?
GEORGE: Oh, no. No stories.
RUSSELL: No stories? So, what is it?
GEORGE: (Showing an example) What'd you do today?
RUSSELL: I got up and came to work.
GEORGE: There's a show. That's a show.
RUSSELL: (Confused) How is that a show?
JERRY: Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.
GEORGE: No, no, no. Nothing happens.
JERRY: Well, something happens.
RUSSELL: Well, why am I watching it?
GEORGE: Because it's on TV.
RUSSELL: (Threatening) Not yet.
GEORGE: Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?
(A moment passes)
JERRY: (To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..
[Monks]
JERRY: I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.
GEORGE: . . . I thought the woman was kind of cute.
JERRY: Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?
GEORGE: Yeah, I thought I might give her a call. I, I don't meet that many women. I meet like three women a year. I mean, we've been introduced. She knows my name.
JERRY: IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!
GEORGE: Why? Maybe she liked me. I, I mean she was looking right at me. You know, I think she was impressed. You know, we had good eye contact the whole meeting.
JERRY: Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
GEORGE: Wait a minute let me call Susan.
JERRY: No, no this is more important.
GEORGE: She might be leaving to work any minute.
JERRY: No, I got to warn him that I told Joe Devola about his party.
GEORGE: No.
(they race to the pay phone)
[Paris hotel room - Dr. Reston and Elaine are kissing]
ELAINE: What is it?
DR. RESTON: I was just thinking about this patient of mine.
ELAINE: What?
DR. RESTON: Just wondering if he's taking his medication.
ELAINE: Well, come on we're on vacation.
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)
KRAMER: Yeah (to buzzer)
GEORGE: (OC) It's George.
JERRY: And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.
KRAMER: Whoa, back up a second.
JERRY: Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.
KRAMER: Why would you think I would invite him?
JERRY: I just a ssumed, ...
KRAMER: Assumed? Never assume anything. I don't want that nut in my house. You know he's on medication.
(George and Susan enter)
GEORGE: Hello, oh, hello. You remember, ... Susan, from N B C.
JERRY: Of course. How are you?
SUSAN: Fine, it's good to see you.
GEORGE: And this is Kramer.
SUSAN: Hello.
GEORGE: All right go ahead Susan, tell him.
JERRY: Tell me what?
SUSAN: Well, I, (phone rings)
JERRY: Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.
TEL: Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service.
JERRY: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later.
TEL: Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.
JERRY: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
TEL: No.
JERRY: Well now you know how I feel. (Hangs up)
GEORGE: Well, go ahead, tell him.
JERRY: Kramer, are you drinking that milk?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: What's the expiration date on that?
KRAMER: September third.
JERRY: The third?
GEORGE: and SUSAN: The third?
KRAMER: Um, Uh, ugh, ...
SUSAN: Noooo... (Kramer throws up on Susan)
[Monk's]
GEORGE: I never should have brought her up there. Should have known better. Should have seen it coming. I didn't see it coming.
JERRY: I think SHE saw it coming.
GEORGE: You know she was behind the idea. She was going to champion the show. That's what I was bring her up there to tell you. And she liked me.
JERRY: Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.
GEORGE: What, are you crazy? It's a traumatic thing to be thrown up on.
JERRY: Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.
GEORGE: Chamberlind, you could hold his head in nthe toilet, he'd still give you half of Europe.
(Kramer enters with helmet)
JERRY: What happened to you?
KRAMER: Devola came after me.
JERRY: What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?
KRAMER: Can I have a coffee. ... What, you know I was walking home and I had to pick up my helmet from the shop, you know. I gota new strap. And I had it on you know, and I was checking the strap out to make sure it fit. Then suddenly I feel this kick hit me on the side of the head. It knocks me down, I look up and it's Crazy Joe Devola. And he say's, "That's what I thin k of your party."
JERRY: Boy, that is some kick.
KRAMER: Well, yeah, Newman's helmet, it saved my life. Look at that.
JERRY: Wow, Newman's helmet.
GEORGE: Holly.
KRAMER: I got bad news for you buddy. Devola says you're next.
JERRY: Me, why?
KRAMER: He doesn't like you.
JERRY: What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.
KRAMER: Pass the cream.
GEORGE: Wait a second. (smells it). all right.
[Jerry's apartment]
(Enter Kramer with one pant leg on)
JERRY: (going through couch cushions) Where the hell did I put this?
KRAMER: What are you looking for?
JERRY: The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?
KRAMER: No, no, no.
(Jerry notices Kramer's look)
JERRY: All right, what is this?
KRAMER: (clueless) what is what?
JERRY: All right, very funny. I get it.
KRAMER: You're in a weird mood.
JERRY: Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
KRAMER: Fix what?
JERRY: Your pants!
(Kramer is startled when he realizes his looks)
KRAMER: what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
JERRY: Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right side of your face! What is this? A joke?
KRAMER: No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?
JERRY: Go look at your face in the mirror.
KRAMER: Wha-huh-wha-huh...
(door buzzer)
JERRY: (pressing intercom) yeah?
GEORGE: (on intercom) It's George.
JERRY: Come on up.
KRAMER: I don't believe this.
JERRY: You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?
KRAMER: No, I swear.
JERRY: I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better see a doctor and get some X-rays.
(Enter George)
GEORGE: (to Kramer) Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
KRAMER: Me?
(George hands Kramer a paper)
GEORGE: Yeah, here you go.
KRAMER: What's this?
GEORGE: A dry-cleaning bill?
JERRY: From that woman at NBC?
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: A dry-cleaning bill for what?
GEORGE: For vomiting on her vest!
KRAMER: Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!
GEORGE: Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!
KRAMER: Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in the refrigerator.
GEORGE: (to Jerry) Yeah, your milk.
JERRY: (pointing Kramer) He drank it.
KRAMER: I didn't know.
JERRY: All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: How much was it to clean the vest?
GEORGE: Eighteen dollars.
JERRY: Can you get vomit out of suede?
GEORGE: I don't know.
KRAMER: Yo-yo Ma!
JERRY: What? Yo-yo Ma?
KRAMER: What about him?
JERRY: You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
GEORGE: What's Yo-yo Ma?
JERRY: He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
GEORGE: All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.
JERRY: I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
GEORGE: I know!
JERRY: That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?
GEORGE: The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a different network
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!
GEORGE: It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted all over her, we'd be writing it right now.
KRAMER: Jeez!
GEORGE: Anyway.
(Phone rings, Kramer picks up. Answers in Italian.)
JERRY: (interrupts) What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll make an appointment for a doctor today. (on the phone) Hello? Oh hi! I'm sorry. No, that's my next door neighbor. He's not quite himself. He got kicked in the head. What? Really? You're kidding! Today? Yeah! Sure! We could make it. Two o'clock? Yeah, we would do that. Okay. Great! Thanks a million! Okay, bye.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
GEORGE: They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
JERRY: I don't know about sixty.
GEORGE: Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson makes, huh?
JERRY: Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?
GEORGE: I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
JERRY: Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!
GEORGE: Oh!
JERRY: You know, I think he wears a piece.
GEORGE: Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.
[Street]
JERRY: I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! I've had it.
(He throws his watch in the trash can beside him)
GEORGE: What, is that the one your parents gave you?
JERRY: Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there by two o'clock. We should take a cab.
GEORGE: All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.
JERRY: I'll pay for it.
GEORGE: It's not the money!
JERRY: Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?
(Both raise their arm to signal a cab.)
LEO: Jerry!
JERRY: Uncle Leo!
LEO: Helloooo!
JERRY: Hello there, how're you doing?
LEO: Ha ha! How are you?
JERRY: Good, good.
LEO: How's your mom and dad?
JERRY: Good, fine.
LEO: What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me a call? I don't hear from you anymore!
JERRY: Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.
LEO: You know where I just came from?
(He grabs Jerry's forearm.)
Danny Barma.
JERRY: (not enthousiastic at all) Oh, sure. Danny.
LEO: He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!
(Leo shakes Jerry around using his grip on Jerry's arm.)
JERRY: Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.
(George gets impatient, touches his watch subtly, maybe subconsciously.)
LEO: The funny thing is: I can't wear 'em. I get too hot. I sleep in my underwear and a t-shirt. If it gets too hot, I just get the t-shirt off! Anyway, Danny says to me: 'You need any pajamas?'
JERRY: (interrupts) I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going.
LEO: Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go.
JERRY: We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.
LEO: Nobody got a gun to your head!
JERRY: (seems sincere) Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh.
LEO: Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment.
JERRY: I'm sorry, really.
LEO: You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!
JERRY: Sorry, really.
(Leo turns around and leaves. He passes by the trash can and sees the watch. He picks it up, takes it to his ear, laughs and puts it on. He walks away.)
[Hall out of Kramer's apartment]
(Newman knocks on Kramer's door)
KRAMER: (from inside) Yeah?
NEWMAN: Come on, are you ready? Let's go!
(Straightens his tie)
(Kramer opens the door. He has shaving cream on his face.)
KRAMER: For what?
NEWMAN: What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes ago.
KRAMER: what about?
NEWMAN: The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting a ticket today.
KRAMER: I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.
NEWMAN: You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to take the stand.
KRAMER: Well, I can't!
NEWMAN: Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!
KRAMER: Shut up! I'll get my coat!
[Newman enters Kramer's apartment]
KRAMER: Don't step on anything.
[NBC's waiting room]
JERRY: You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation with one of my relatives.
GEORGE: I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
JERRY: You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go: 'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'
GEORGE: Look at this.
JERRY: Why didn't you shave this morning?
GEORGE: 'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Because of the day before. It's a long story.
(Jerry looks down the hall.)
Can't get back on schedule.
JERRY: Is that Joe Davola?
(Jerry crouches in his seat)
GEORGE: It's not him!
JERRY: I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
Receptionist: Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.
JERRY: Oh.
(They get up)
GEORGE: Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
(They walk toward the office)
JERRY: All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.
GEORGE: Okay. A little.
[Courthouse waiting room]
NEWMAN: Okay, you're all set? You got your story?
KRAMER: No.
NEWMAN: When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because my friend was about to commit suicide.
KRAMER: Uhm...
NEWMAN: Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you were going to commit suicide.
(Pause; they're thinking)
KRAMER: I never had an air conditioner.
NEWMAN: No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
KRAMER: Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to sleep in a really hot room?
NEWMAN: Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill myself.
KRAMER: Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.
NEWMAN: No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.
KRAMER: I was never able to become a banker.
(Newman has a revelation.)
NEWMAN: Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being a banker.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.
NEWMAN: You must be banker.
KRAMER: MUST be banker.
NEWMAN (satisfied): Okay, we'll go with the banker story.
[NBC office]
(I might be missing a line here, I suck at cutting the commercials. If so, please complete.)
GEORGE: The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.
(George is the only one laughing)
RUSSEL: And people really have to care about the characters.
GEORGE: Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?
JERRY: Wouldn't tune in.
GEORGE: Would they tune in?
JERRY: No tune.
RUSSEL: We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your highs and your lows and it goes up and down.
GEORGE: The show will be like a heart attack!
JERRY: Just a huge massive coronary.
RUSSEL: So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible on that now.
GEORGE: Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell me later.
JERRY: He couldn't believe it.
GEORGE: (Laughs, snorts) I said, I said: 'Get outta here! No story? Is that what I said?'
(Jerry and George laugh)
[Courtroom]
Police officer: Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.
JUDGE: And then what happened?
Police officer: Well, then he became very loud and hysterical. He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and then he begged me to let him go. And when I refused, that's when he began to scream: 'My friend's going to die, my friend's going to die.'
[NBC office]
RUSSEL: Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really like to be in business with you.
(George starts, Jerry starts later, both speak at the same time, nonstop)
GEORGE: Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll have some business. Let's have business.
JERRY: We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. It's... it's business. This is business.
GEORGE: Yeah!
Stu: Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
(Pause. George and Jerry are puzzled.)
(Jerry gets it, pokes George.)
JERRY: Your off-Broadway play.
GEORGE: Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell you something. I'm not through with that moving company.
JERRY: (backs his story) Hmm, hmm.
GEORGE: That's my vow to you.
RUSSEL: Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment.
(the lady is Susan)
(George and Jerry both speak at the same time, nonstop)
GEORGE: Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
JERRY: Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.
RUSSEL: (gets up) So, let's make a pilot.
(Hand shakes)
[Courtroom]
NEWMAN: I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became a banker.
JUDGE: I don't understand.
NEWMAN: You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But I distinctly recall him say...
KRAMER: (interupts involuntarily) Yo-yo Ma!
NEWMAN: So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.
JUDGE: So then he didn't kill himself.
NEWMAN: No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the courtroom today
(Stands up, points to Kramer.) (dramatically) sitting right over there! And he can corroborate my entire testimony.
[NBC's waiting room]
(Jerry and George are coming out of the office)
GEORGE: See?
JERRY: Yeah!
GEORGE: I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!
JERRY: Now, all we gotta do is write it.
GEORGE: Yes! How're we gonna do that?
(Enter Susan)
SUSAN: Hey! Congratulations!
JERRY: Thanks.
GEORGE: Oh, thank you.
JERRY: Thank you, thanks.
GEORGE: Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.
SUSAN: No.
Receptionist: Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call.
JERRY: Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
(He picks up the phone)
Hello? Mom? How'd you know I was here? Oh, I was not rude to him, that is baloney! I couldn't talk! I couldn't talk! I had a meeting! I don't know... he-he went off on something about pajamas!
GEORGE: When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought the show didn't have a chance.
SUSAN: Oh, it was only vomit.
GEORGE: Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.
SUSAN: Oh no-no, it's okay. *comment from transcriber: yeah, she doesn't want to be paid, didn't she send the bill?*
GEORGE: No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.
SUSAN: Well, it was eighteen dollars.
GEORGE: Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.
SUSAN: Yeah. Call me.
GEORGE: All right, great.
SUSAN: Bye.
JERRY: Bye thanks.
GEORGE: (chuckles) Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't believe she took the money.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: I offered to pay. She should've said no.
JERRY: She did, you insisted.
GEORGE: Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's vest.
JERRY: Nah!
GEORGE: How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?
JERRY: oh, I d-I don't know. I d---
GEORGE: Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.
JERRY: Okay.
GEORGE: (excited, pushing Jerry forward) All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, come on.
[Coffee shop]
GEORGE: Thirteen thousand?
JERRY: Thirteen thousand.
GEORGE: a piece?
JERRY: No, for both!
GEORGE: That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars an episode.
JERRY: Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?
GEORGE: Well, he does.
JERRY: You're nuts!
GEORGE: I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more than me. Who is he?
JERRY: He's somebody.
GEORGE: What about me?
JERRY: You're nobody.
GEORGE: Why him? Why not me?
JERRY: He's good, you're not.
GEORGE: I'm better than him.
JERRY: You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!
GEORGE: (crouches too) What? Where? Where?
JERRY: Outside! I saw him outside!
[Europe]
(Elaine is kissing with a guy. He stops. She keeps kissing him, then stops.)
ELAINE: what is it?
BOYFRIEND: Oh, it's this patient.
ELAINE: (sighing) Again?
BOYFRIEND: I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription for his medication.
ELAINE: Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.
BOYFRIEND: Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.
(Elaine turns around, rolls her eyes.)
[Coffee shop]
JERRY: Go outside and see if he's still there.
GEORGE: I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.
JERRY: Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.
(A cop sits down at the counter.)
GEORGE: Tell the cop.
JERRY: Good idea.
(Walks to counter)
Excuse me officer. There's a guy outside and he's kind of a nut job and I think he's waiting to beat me up. If you could just walk me outside and wait till I get into a cab.
COP: Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.
JERRY: Thanks.
(Jerry waits a while and realizes he has to go sit back with George and wait over there.)
JERRY: (back in booth) He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us outside. This is a great way to go through life.
(Looks over at the cop)
Hey! He's looking at the menu now. What's he looking at the menu for?!
GEORGE: I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
(Jerry gets up and walks to the counter)
JERRY: (bossy) What are you doing?
COP: What?
JERRY: What, are you ordering food now?
COP: Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.
JERRY: What happened to the muffin?
COP: I got a little hungry.
JERRY: All of a sudden you get hungry?
COP: Yeah! You got a problem with that?
JERRY: No! Enjoy your lunch.
(Goes back toward the booth and stops.)
You know a muffin can be very filling.
(Keeps walking to the booth) (to George) He's getting a sandwich now!
GEORGE: I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
JERRY: All of a sudden he gets hungry.
GEORGE: You know, a muffin can be very filling.
JERRY: I know!
[Courtroom]
NEWMAN: (interrogating Kramer) Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened on the afternoon of September 10th?
KRAMER: What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
NEWMAN: You know what I mean.
KRAMER: (to Judge) I was very upset that day.
NEWMAN: And why was that?
KRAMER: (to Newman) Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
NEWMAN: All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.
KRAMER: All right.
NEWMAN: Okay.
KRAMER: (to Judge) I was very upset that day because I could never become a banker.
NEWMAN: And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating at you inside.
KRAMER: (not convincing) Uh, yeah.
NEWMAN: It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their dream for you...
JUDGE: Mister Newman.
NEWMAN: Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile emotional state, my entire case depends on it.
JUDGE: Uh, continue.
NEWMAN: As you were saying, Mister Kramer...
KRAMER: What was the question?
NEWMAN: You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
KRAMER: Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy, take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'
NEWMAN: But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why did you fail?
KRAMER: I don't know.
NEWMAN: It was because you hated your father and you would do anything to displease him. Isn't THAT true?
JUDGE: Uh, could you get to the speeding?
NEWMAN: Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?
KRAMER: (puzzled) Phone call?
NEWMAN: Yes, a phone call!
KRAMER: From who?
NEWMAN: From me!
KRAMER: From you?
NEWMAN: Yes, from me!! I called you remember?
KRAMER: You called me?
NEWMAN: Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You were going to... Remember?
KRAMER: what?
NEWMAN: You were going to...
(Mimmicks hanging himself, growing hysterical as only Newman can)
You were going to do something
(Mimmicks stabbing himself in stomach and jerking the knife around) to yourself! You were going to do something to yourself! Remember the banking? The banking, about the banking, about the banking!!!
JUDGE: I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---
NEWMAN: Yes, the banker!!!
KRAMER: What banking?
NEWMAN: A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...
JUDGE: That's enough already.
NEWMAN: Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.
KRAMER: I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
NEWMAN: (to Kramer) You shut up! (to judge) I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him regain hius composure.
JUDGE: That'll be seventy-five dollars.
NEWMAN: (Strangling Kramer) What's the matter with you? We had it all worked out!
(They fall on their backs. Kramer knocks the flag on judge.)
[Coffee shop]
JERRY: Do you see him?
GEORGE: I'm not* sure.
JERRY: Well, either you see him or you don't.
GEORGE: All right. I don't.
JERRY: (looking at the cop) What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I think he's getting coffee.!
GEORGE: What's with this guy?
(Jerry walks to the counter)
JERRY: (still bossy) Did you just order coffee?
COP: Yeah.
JERRY: This is really too much.
COP: What is your problem?
JERRY: Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another ten minutes.
COP: Well, you're just gonna have to wait.
(Enter Kramer and Newman)
KRAMER: Never said anything about the banking.
NEWMAN: You're off your rocker.
JERRY: Hey you guys!
KRAMER: Hey!
JERRY: What are you doing here?
KRAMER: What are YOU doing here?
JERRY: Hey, is Davola outside?
KRAMER: Davola?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: No, I didn't see him.
NEWMAN: Crazy Joe Davola?
GEORGE: (reading the tabs) Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.
JERRY: Eleven dollars for what?
GEORGE: Muffin, sandwich and coffee!
JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.
KRAMER: You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?
JERRY: No.
NEWMAN: Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty thousand?
GEORGE: What's the difference? The money is not important.
JERRY: (looking outside) Hey Newman, is that your red car?
NEWMAN: Yeah.
JERRY: I think you're getting a ticket.
NEWMAN: Deh!
KRAMER: Run, run! Go, go, go!
(Newman runs outside)
NEWMAN: Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. I got witnesses.
KRAMER: I saw the whole thing!
JERRY: Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
GEORGE: Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.
JERRY: Oh, like you know what you're talking about!
GEORGE: No, YOU do!
[Opening monologue]
My parents had two constant arguments, while ah, they were driving, over either how fast my father was going, or how much gas was left in the tank.  My father had a standard defense for either one of these, it was always, that's because you're looking at it from an angle.  If you were over here -- it looks from where you're sitting, it looks like I'm doing 90 on empty... but that's because you're over there.  If you were over here you'd know I'm in the driveway with a full tank.?  (makes the steering wheel motion with hands)
[In Jerry's Car]
JERRY: So George and I went up to NBC and we told them the idea for a series now we're just waiting to sign the contract.
HELEN: And they liked the idea?
JERRY: Yeah.
MORTY: What'ya got leather seats here?
HELEN: Since when is George a writer?
JERRY: What writer? It's a sitcom.
HELEN: This is so exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
JERRY: Soon, there's a couple of problems.
MORTY: Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst.
JERRY: What do you expect? It's airline food.
MORTY: They give you that *Fish.*
JERRY: How could you eat fish on a plane?
MORTY: because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece of meat.
HELEN: What kind of problems?
JERRY: Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.
HELEN: What? He's not even working.
MORTY: George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. Believe me. They're all crooks.
HELEN: Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
JERRY: We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George is out with the woman from NBC right now.
[George's car]
GEORGE: So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.
SUSAN: Yu - you're passing?
GEORGE: Well, it's . . . much too low.
SUSAN: Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
GEORGE: tsh (snorts) Ah, yeah, we've - we've talked . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.
SUSAN: Well be-because you know that, because this is your first show it's a pretty standard deal.
GEORGE: Standard?
SUSAN: Yeah.
GEORGE: Is Ted Danson's deal standard?
SUSAN: Ted Danson?
GEORGE: You know, the guy from Cheers.
SUSAN: Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson.
GEORGE: I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
SUSAN: All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
GEORGE: You tell Russell.
SUSAN: Oh, um, before I forget, . . . Cuban cigars. It's a present from my father.
GEORGE: Oh... do I have to write him a note or something?
SUSAN: Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that.
GEORGE: Well what would I say in the note?
SUSAN: Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something.
GEORGE: Oh-ohf (snorts) yeah, I'm a writer. (laughs)
[Jerry's car at gas station]
HELEN: Were you waiting long at the gate?
JERRY: Um, I don't even know?
HELEN: Where's that watch we bought you?
JERRY: Oh uh ...
(Flashback to street)
JERRY: That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch in garbage)
GEORGE: Wha-Is that the one your parents gave you?
JERRY: Yeah, but it never works.
(Back to present day in car at gas station)
JERRY: . . . it's uh, being fixed.
MORTY: I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back to where we got it.
JERRY: It's at the jeweler.
MORTY: You send me the bill.
JERRY: I'm not sending you the bill.
HELEN: That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
GAS STATION ATTENDANT: That's uh, $18.50.
MORTY: Here, I got it.
JERRY: What are you talking about? It's my car. Let me pay for the gas.
MORTY: No, no put it away . . .
JERRY: Dad!
MORTY: Stop it.
JERRY: I have money. I make money.
MORTY: Yeah, yeah, you make money.
JERRY: You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
HELEN: No, I don't think that.
JERRY: Yes you do. That's what you both think.
MORTY: I'm paying.
JERRY: Dad I'm paying.
MORTY: Get out of here.
JERRY: You're not paying.
(both fighting to pay - trying to hand cash out the window)
MORTY: Now Jerry please, do not do this to your father.  Over my dead body Jerry.  I'll tell you right now, you're not going to do it.
JERRY: No don't do this.  You're not doing this. I will fight you. No you don't... No.
[Jerry's apartment -- Jerry is carrying two suitcases, Morty carries one]
JERRY: Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?
MORTY: Nothing nothing.
JERRY: Leave it. What about your back?
HELEN: Morty, what are you doing?
MORTY: All right, all right.
JERRY: You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're lifting heavy suit cases.
(Kramer enters -- he has a bandage on his left temple)
KRAMER: Hey, Morty.
MORTY: Hey, Mr. Kramer. Ha ha ha.
KRAMER: Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld. Hi
HELEN: Ha, ha, ha Oh, What happened to you?
KRAMER: Oh, ah, well some guy kicked me in the side of the head.
HELEN: What guy?
KRAMER: Ah, w-Crazy Joe Devola.
HELEN: Why?
KRAMER: Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and then Jerry, tipped him off.
JERRY: Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him to his party?
JERRY: I didn't know he wasn't invited.
MORTY: Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for these Jerry?
HELEN: So why did you say anything?
JERRY: It was a mistake.
MORTY: They're good around the house -- and they're good for outside.
HELEN: Are you okay?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week, huh Jerry -- Yeah but the doctor says it was just a slight concussion
HELEN: So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
JERRY: He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. He's after Jerry now.
JERRY: Kramer!!
HELEN: He's what?!
JERRY: He's joking.
HELEN: He's after you?
JERRY: Nooo.
HELEN: Why is he after you?
JERRY: He's not after me.
HELEN: Morty, do you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry.
MORTY: I'll make a few phone calls.
JERRY: Who you gonna to call?
MORTY: What are you worried about?
HELEN: I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
JERRY: I didn't do anything.
HELEN: Well you must have done something.
JERRY: No, he just doesn't like me.
HELEN: Doesn't like you?  How could anyone not like you?
JERRY: You know it seems impossible.
HELEN: Doesn't - doesn't like you? How could that be?
JERRY: Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure there are many people who do not like me.
HELEN: Huh, Jerry, don't say that.
JERRY: It's true.
HELEN: No, it isn't!  it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?
MORTY: Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
HELEN: Kramer?
KRAMER: Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?
JERRY: Um, I haven't got my watch on. It's being fixed.
KRAMER: When you getting it back?
JERRY: Uh, next week.
KRAMER: Next week? How come it's takin' so long?
JERRY: Huh?
KRAMER: I said how come it's takin' so long?
JERRY: I don't know. They're, backed up.
KRAMER: Wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?
JERRY: Where'd I take it?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing a knife into a cutting board)  Umm, to that place on, uh Columbus and 85th. Okay?
KRAMER: What? Jimmy Sherman?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.
JERRY: No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him.
KRAMER: No, I'd be happy to. He's a friend of mine.
JERRY: I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special treatment.
KRAMER: Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy. You see.
MORTY: Bring me the receipt.
KRAMER: I get that too. (exits)
JERRY: Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
[In the hallway]
(Jerry hits Kramer on the back as he is going in to his apartment.  Kramer spits out some Pepsi as he spins around to talk with Jerry.)
JERRY: There's no watch ... I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep good time. My parents gave it to me, but I didn't like it.  So don't mention it again, okay!
KRAMER: Y-Yeah, all right.
JERRY: All right.
KRAMER: Wait, wait, . . .y-yea, w-no dit dit g- (Kramer noises)
(Jerry re-enters his own apartment)
HELEN: What was that about?
KRAMER: Oh, no, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got a thing on his ankle.
HELEN: How can anyone not like him.
[Back at the doctor's office]
MORTY: Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill this out.
(she hands him a clip board with some forms)
MORTY: All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
RECEPTIONIST: I know. It's very long.
MORTY: Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. Whydo they need this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on the convertible sofa. (hu hu) My back was fine.
HELEN: Well, it's not the sofa.
MORTY: You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person.
HELEN: We got it from Sullivan's. It's a good store.
MORTY: Well one day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get sued.  I hope this doctor knows what he's doing.
HELEN: Leo says he's the best there is.
MORTY: Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!
HELEN: Well you're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know what the waiting list is for this guy?
MORTY: Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, you got my name, you got my address. That's enough.
RECEPTIONIST: Julie, you want to take him back?
[Jerry's Apartment]
JERRY: You what? You passed? How could you do that?
GEORGE: ahhhhh (exhaling) Jerry, my young friend, you're so naïve. You are so, so naïve. You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I'm negotiating.  Negotiation, this is what'cha do in business.
JERRY: Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, that's it. They go to the next show.
GEORGE: Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ohoooo they're not going to do the show.
JERRY: We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, they're up there going, hey maybe we should give those two guys, who have no experience and no idea, more money!?
GEORGE: Ohooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
JERRY: Well, I think you're wrong.
GEORGE: Well, we'll just see.
JERRY: Yes we will.
GEORGE: Yes we will.
JERRY: I just said that.
GEORGE: I know you did.
JERRY: So good for you.
GEORGE: So good for you.
JERRY: What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
GEORGE: What are you repeating everything I'm saying?
JERRY: Well George is an idiot.
GEORGE: Well George . . . .
[Doctor's examination room]
MORTY: All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . .(open the door and shouts into the hallway) Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please help me.
HELEN: (enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
MORTY: Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes.
HELEN: Well the doctor must be busy.
MORTY: Well then what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. Huh, hha. Look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel.
(a nurse walks in the room)
NURSE: Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.
MORTY: I thought you forgot about me.
NURSE: We didn't forget.
(pulls apart the Velcro blood pressure band)
MORTY: HaAhhh! The Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines.
NURSE: Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays.
MORTY: Leave all my stuff here?
NURSE: Leave it.
(They exit)
[Jerry's Apartment]
GEORGE: Oh hey, by the way. Do you want a box 'a, Cuban cigars? I smoked one last night. I got nauseous.
JERRY: No I don't want ?em.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?
GEORGE: Here you go.
KRAMER: Cigars? (hits the box)
GEORGE: Yeah, Cubans.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah?
GEORGE: Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked. You can't buy ?em anywhere.
KRAMER: Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)
(Kramer puts a cigar in his mouth then goes and sits at the table -- George gets a jar of peanut butter from the fridge and stands at the kitchen counter opening it.)
(Intercom Buzzer)
JERRY: Yeah?
VOICE: Federal Express.
JERRY: Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting a package.
KRAMER: Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar in the building.
JERRY: You think so?
KRAMER: Federal Express? Of course. That's the oldest trick in the book. You know it might not be a burglar it could be a murderer.
JERRY: So you want to just abolish all home package deliveries.
KRAMER: Yes. It's dangerous.
(Knock on the door)
KRAMER: wait det doit ... dit  (Kramer noises -- he prepares for a fight by rolling up a magazine)
JERRY: Who is it?
Voice: Federal Express.
KRAMER: Okay, ... gidg gi gt  (backs up and bends his knees, holding the rolled magazine - arm back, ready for a rumble)
(Jerry opens the door -- it's Elaine)
ALL: Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
(Lots of running in place from Jerry, Elaine and George -- with joy and excitement and hands clapping - Elaine jumps into Jerry's arms and hugs him, then turns to George and gives him a big hug with pats on the back -- then turns to Kramer and hugs him.)
KRAMER: I want one of those!
ELAINE: Hiiii Kramer
KRAMER: Oh yes
ELAINE: Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.
KRAMER: Well I came back for you.
ELAINE: Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)
JERRY: I missed you.
ELAINE: Really? You really missed me?
JERRY: Yeah, . . . seriously.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, me to miss -- I miss.
JERRY: Yeah, big missing goin' on (spreads arms wide)
ELAINE: Ahhhhhh haa ha ha
KRAMER: Hey, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
ELAINE: Oh god, Who's suitcase is this?
JERRY: Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.
ELAINE: Oh, god, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.
(Elaine tosses her purse down and goes to the refrigerator and gets a bottled water)
GEORGE: Boy, you look really great.
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: You lie.
GEORGE: No, no you really look great.
ELAINE: Hu hu, ha ha ha.
JERRY: So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
ELAINE: Oh, he's fine.
JERRY: Things are good?
ELAINE: Yeah, you know (scratches cheek and sniffs)
JERRY: Uh oh.
ELAINE: What, Uh oh?
JERRY: Did you see that?
GEORGE: Yeah, I saw it.
(George grabs the jar of peanut butter from the kitchen counter -- he goes and sits on the couch -- he proceeds to sit quietly and eat from the jar of peanut butter.)
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: It's a tell. You gotta tell.
ELAINE: What tell? What's a tell?
JERRY: When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their face, you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going with somebody.
ELAINE: Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?
JERRY: Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty good - not bad - I gotta get out.  (scratches chin, nose then covers eyes with hands)
ELAINE: How high did I go?
GEORGE: You almost did the nose.
JERRY: What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display. (takes the peanut butter jar away from George)
GEORGE: What? I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
JERRY: (To George) You're off bread.  (To Elaine) So what happened is it over?
(Jerry puts the lid on the peanut butter jar and put's it back in the fridge.)
ELAINE: No not quite.
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: Well he was my psychiatrist, you know. I mean, he knows all my patterns. He knows In relationships that I always try to find some reason to leave, and so, he says as my doctor, he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.
GEORGE: What do you mean - "Not letting you?"
ELAINE: He has this power over me, okay. I mean he has this way of manipulating every little word that I say. He's like a Svenjolly.
JERRY: Svengali.
ELAINE: What did I say?
JERRY: Svenjolly.
ELAINE: Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
JERRY: George?
GEORGE: Svenjolly. (licking a little bit of peanut butter from his finger)
ELAINE: I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
JERRY: Well maybe he's got like a, cheerful mental hold on you.
(Elaine makes a face with her jaw going up and down like she is saying laa, laa, laa, laa, laa; Kramer enters)
KRAMER: You know I can't find a match anywhere.
GEORGE: You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're seeing  somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.
ELAINE: No, it's not going to work with this guy.
GEORGE: No, you just tell him ah, an old boyfriend has come back into your life.
ELAINE: I don't think so.
JERRY: Nice try.
GEORGE: Took a shot.
KRAMER: This is a good cigar (hair is on fire, white smoke pouring from the back of his head) . . . . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . . (runs to bathroom, his arms in the air -- he bangs them in to the top of the hallway door jam and falls into the bathroom)
[Doctor's examining room. Morty enters]
MORTY: So, when do I get to see the doctor?
NURSE: He'll be in with the X-Rays in a few minutes. You can get dressed. (leaves)
MORTY: (checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. (opens door, shouts into the hallway) MY WALLET'S GONE!  MY WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It's gone.
NURSE: Are you sure?
MORTY: Yes, I'm sure. I went in to get my X-Ray, Somebody takes my wallet. Is that the operation here?
(doctor enters)
DR. DEMBROW: Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow, I've been going over your X-rays.
MORTY: I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody stole my wallet. I had $225 in there.
DR. DEMBROW: Well, I don't see how something like that could have happened.
MORTY: Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me.
HELEN: (enters) What's going on?
MORTY: They stole my wallet.
HELEN: What?
MORTY: Yeah, while I was in getting X-Rayed.
DR. DEMBROW: All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but would you like me to look over these X-Rays?
MORTY: What kind of clip joint are ya running here?
DR. DEMBROW: All right, fine. (leaves)
HELEN: The least you could have done was heard your diagnosis.
MORTY: I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
HELEN: You came all the way from Florida to see him.
MORTY: I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't leave your pants in the room. You tell me.
[Dr. Reston's office]
ELAINE: I'm sorry but there's somebody else.
DR. RESTON: Umm hm.
ELAINE: Well it's, nothing I planned on happening, you know. It just, kind of happened.
DR. RESTON: Tell me about him.
ELAINE: Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a guy, Really.
DR. RESTON: Yes, well I assumed he's a guy.
ELAINE: Right...
DR. RESTON: And you've known him how long?
ELAINE: . . . Years. Many years (her voice cracks), um, (clears throat) we've been close friends and then recently something just you know *ehghh* happened.
DR. RESTON: You mean sexually?
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.
(phone rings)
ELAINE: I think your um ... (points at the phone)
DR. RESTON: Excuse me. Yes, Oh yes, Bobo.  Uh, no it's just east of Madison. Around 4:00 will be fine. All right Bobo ... see you then. (hangs up) . . . I'm sorry where were we?
ELAINE: Well, I was just um, telling you about this, other guy.
DR. RESTON: Mm. Elaine ...
ELAINE: Yeah
DR. RESTON: Do you remember your dream, where you have a sexual encounter with a Chinese woman?
ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) Mm-hm.
DR. RESTON: Elaine, I'm concerned about you.
ELAINE: Oh, no no no no, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm - I'm good. I'm - I'm very good, I mean I'm really very, very good.
DR. RESTON: Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?
ELAINE: . . . no.
DR. RESTON: And how often have you been seeing, um . . .? I'm sorry what is his name?
ELAINE: H-his name?
DR. RESTON: Yes, his name.
ELAINE: Um, well what's the difference?
DR. RESTON: Are you afraid to tell me his name?
ELAINE: No, no, I just - I just don't see how that's relevant.
DR. RESTON: It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
ELAINE: Uh, his name, um, I don't  - I don't even know, all right you want to know his name? I'll - I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.
DR. RESTON: Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?
ELAINE: Oh, I'm - I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.
DR. RESTON: Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.
ELAINE: What?
DR. RESTON: I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It's very important that I speak to him.
ELAINE: Oh, oh no, no no no, I can't do that.
DR. RESTON: You can do it and you will do it.
ELAINE: No, I can't.
DR. RESTON: You can and you will.
ELAINE: Okay, okay.  Yeah I'll have Kramer give you a call.
[Restaurant]
JERRY: So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
MORTY: I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.
HELEN: Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
MORTY: What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere?
HELEN: You could've taken it with you.
MORTY: Oh, yeah, I'll be lying on an X-Ray table with my wallet in my mouth.
(Leo enters)
LEO: Hello...
JERRY: Hi Uncle Leo.
LEO: I just talked to Dr. Dembrow's son. He said they almost had to call the police.
MORTY: What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called the police. They stole my wallet.
LEO: You know how hard it was for me to get that appointment for you? You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor.
MORTY: All right, Leo.
LEO: And you walked out without paying.
MORTY: How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet.
LEO: Well, I hope you send him a check.
MORTY: What for?
LEO: What for? This man was nice enough to see you. He did me a personal favor.
MORTY: That's the second time you said "personal favor". Why do you keep saying that?
LEO: I said it once.
MORTY: Twice! And Dembrow doesn't even know you. His son happens to live on your floor.
(Leo does a little chair dance in his seat -- Mocking Morty with his hands and mouth)
HELEN: Leo, where did you get that watch?
LEO: You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?
HELEN: Morty, doesn't that watch look like the one that we gave Jerry.
(Morty reaches across the table at the watch on Leo's wrist)
JERRY: Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. Let's live a little. .
HELEN: Let me see that.
(looking at watch)
JERRY: Could we continue this another time.
[Closing monologue]
Don't you hate "The End
[Montage]
(The episode opens with a series of clips from 'The Pitch', 'The Ticket' and 'TheWallet', illustrating the story so far. A rough precis would be: George turns down the offer from NBC for the show, telling Jerry he's negotiating. Susan gives George a box of Cuban cigars from her father, which hepasses to Kramer, who sets fire to his hair while lighting one. Jerry's parents come to town, so's Morty can see a back specialist - he slept on the fold-out. Kramer tells Jerry's parents that Crazy Joe Davola is after Jerry. Jerry throws away a watch his parents gave him, because it doesn't keep time. Uncle Leo fetches it out of the garbage. Jerry tells his parents his watch is at the jeweller for repair. At the doctor's, Morty reveals his hatred of velcro and his wallet disappears. Elaine returns from Europe, eager to rid herself of the 'Svenjolly' Dr Reston. George tells her to inform the doctor she's seeing someone else. Elaine opts to say she's seeing Kramer, and Dr Reston wants to meet him.)
[Opening Monologue]
JERRY: It's an entire industry of bad gifts, aren't they? All those executive gifts, any stupid, goofy, brass, wood thing, they put a piece of green felt on the bottom. "It's a golf, desk, tie and stress organiser, dad." But to me, nothing compares with the paperweight as a bad gift. There's no better way than a paperweight, to express to someone that, "I refuse to put any thought into this at all." Where are these people working that the papers are just blowing right off of their desks? What, are their desks screwed to the back of a flat-bed truck going down the highway or something? What, are they typing up in the crow's nest of a clipper ship? What do you need a paperweight for?
[Restaurant]
(Jerry, Helen and Morty Seinfeld and uncle Leo are having dinner.)
MORTY: (to Leo) I don't understand this jeweller, Jimmy Sherman. (indicates Jerry) He brings in a watch, it takes over a week to fix. He fixed yours in one day.
JERRY: Oh, you know these jewellers, they're enigmas. They're mysteries, wrapped in a riddle.
(Morty sits, brooding a little. A hostess, Naomi, passes the table. Helen watches her.)
HELEN: (indicating to Jerry) She's very attractive.
JERRY: She's okay.
HELEN: Just okay?
JERRY: She's nice.
HELEN: She's better than nice.
JERRY: She's all right.
HELEN: She's beautiful.
JERRY: She's not beautiful.
HELEN: I think she's beautiful.
JERRY: So you ask her out.
HELEN: I'm not gonna ask her out.
JERRY: Why not?
HELEN: If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.
JERRY: She's pretty. She's not beautiful.
HELEN: I should drop dead if she's not beautiful.
JERRY: I think that's a little extreme.
LEO: (grudgingly) She's awright.
MORTY: (oblivious to the above) Two exact same watches. He tells you a week, and him a day. How could that be? Something's fishy about this.
[George's Car]
GEORGE: He said what?
SUSAN: "The hell with them."
GEORGE: "The hell with them?"
SUSAN: Those were his exact words.
GEORGE: (worried) Oh boy.
SUSAN: He said, "We've got five hundred shows to choose from. Why should we give two guys, who have no idea, and no experience, more money?"
GEORGE: (still worried) He was pretty emphatic?
SUSAN: Pounded on his desk.
GEORGE: Pounded?
SUSAN: (tossing her purse on the dash) I told you to take the offer.
GEORGE: (getting animated) Look I, I uh, I had nothing to do with this. It wasn't my decision. It was Jerry! Jerry told me no. I'm the creative guy. He handles the business end.
SUSAN: You said it was insulting.
GEORGE: I was quoting him. Why would I be insulted? I'm never insulted. You could call me baldy, dump soup on my head. Nothing insults me.
SUSAN: Well, there's nothing I can do.
GEORGE: Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?
SUSAN: Yeah, that's the way Russell is. He doesn't like to play games.
GEORGE: Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?
SUSAN: You'll have to wait til Monday.
GEORGE: Mon...? No, no, I can't wait til Monday, that's impossible, I gotta talk to him now. Where does he live?
SUSAN: (laugh) I can't give you his address.
(George looks frustrated for a second, then notices Susan's purse on the dash. He grabs it, Susan grabs it and a struggle ensues.)
SUSAN: Give it back!
GEORGE: Gimme the purse!
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Elaine and Kramer sit on the couch. )
ELAINE: Okay, so he just wants to talk to you. I couldn't talk him out of it. So you just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. Can you do that?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend.
ELAINE: Okay.
KRAMER: Have we been intimate?
ELAINE: Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.
KRAMER: Alright, how often do we do it?
ELAINE: Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna ask you that?
KRAMER: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
ELAINE: Alright, alright. We do it, uh... (thinks) five times a week, okay?
KRAMER: (suggestive) Oooh, baby. (smiles)
ELAINE: Oh, man. Alright, listen. Just tell me something, what are you gonna say?
KRAMER: I know what I'm gonna say.
ELAINE: No, no, but I would like to hear it.
KRAMER: No, no. I don't wanna say it out loud. Kills the spontaneity. You know, Gleason, he never rehearsed. (indicates phone) 'Kay, go 'head, do it.
(Elaine picks up the phone, while Kramer prepares himself.)
ELAINE: (dialling) Alright, okay. You talk to him.
KRAMER: (playing with his hair) Talk to him.
ELAINE: Hey, how's your hair?
KRAMER: Oh, well, yeah, it's good.
ELAINE: (handing over the phone) You're not the type that should be playing with matches, seriously Kramer.
KRAMER: (listens) Uh, yes. Uh uh, Doctor uh, Reston, is he in? Well, this is Kramer and uh, he's expecting my call.
ELAINE: (mouths silently) Okay.
(Kramer holds on. He begins to sing along with the hold music.)
KRAMER: (singing) ...Johnny ...was a rebel. He rode through the land...
(He waggles his eyebrows at Elaine, who gives a 'what the hell is he doing?' look.)
KRAMER: ...Yu uh, yes, yes uh, uh, Doctor Reston. Uhm well, hello there. Ahh yeah, well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's...
ELAINE: (animated, but quietly) No, no. Not friends.
KRAMER: ...Well, actually uh, we're uh, we're not friends Uh, we're uh, we're much more than friends...
(Elaine signals her approval, indicating that Kramer should keep going.)
KRAMER: ...and uh, I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem. Well, the point is, doctor uh, I'm very much in love with Elaine...
(Elaine smiles.)
KRAMER: ...and uh, she's very much in love with me, and uh, well uh, we would uh, appreciate it if you would cease and desist, and allow us to pursue our courtship unfettered.
(Elaine looks extremely pleased, she gives Kramer okay gestures.)
ELAINE: (mouths silently) That's perfect!
KRAMER: If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I can make things very unpleasant for you and your staff. If you have one.
(Elaine looks even happier. She slaps Kramer on the arm to indicate he's doing so well.)
KRAMER: Yes. Yeah, but the point that I... (listens)
(Elaine's smile begins to look a bit stiff.)
KRAMER: ...Ah, ye... (listens) Well, no... Uh, yeah, that's possible...
(Elaine's face starts to look a bit sick.)
KRAMER: (listens) ...Well, I suppose I could, (turns away from Elaine) but I'd have to shift a few things around, uhm... Hold on for a second, will you? Uh...
(Kramer reaches down and picks up a writing pad, he puts it on his knee. Elaine watches, looking increasingly confused and worried.)
KRAMER: ... Uh, go ahead, yeah. (listens and makes a note) Alright uh... Yeah, yeah, okay... I look forward to it too. (listens) Eh, hah, okay. So long.
(Kramer hangs up the phone.)
ELAINE: What happened? What'd he say? (indicates pad) What's going on here?
KRAMER: Uh, okay now. He uh, you know, he uh, wants to get together.
ELAINE: (horrified) Get together!!
KRAMER: He wants to talk.
ELAINE: Well, why didn't you say no!!
KRAMER: (momentary confusion) Wha...? Uh... (thoughtful) That's interesting.
(Elaine flops back into the couch, let down again by Kramer.)
ELAINE: (frustration) Ugh!
[Restaurant]
(Naomi, the hostess, stands by the Seinfeld's table.)
NAOMI: Did you enjoy your poisson?
HELEN: It was... different.
NAOMI: (to Jerry) And how was yours?
JERRY: Ah, very good.
NAOMI: You should try our mousse. (a little flirtatious) It'll change your life expectancy.
JERRY: No thanks, just the check.
(Naomi leaves.)
HELEN: What's the matter with you?
JERRY: What?
HELEN: Why didn't you flirt with her?
JERRY: Come on.
HELEN: She was flirting with you. Why didn't you say something?
JERRY: What am I gonna say?
HELEN: You just sat there.
JERRY: Well, you made me uncomfortable.
HELEN: You're a comedian, couldn't you come up with something?
LEO: (to Morty) Where's the bathroom?
JERRY: In the back, on your right.
(Leo gets up and leaves. The busboy brings the check to the table. As he puts it down, Morty takes hold of it. Jerry grabs it too. A tug of war develops.)
JERRY: Dad!
MORTY: Will you stop it Jerry. Let go.
HELEN: Jerry.
JERRY: Will you let me pay just once.
MORTY: You're out of your mind.
JERRY: How you gonna pay? You don't even have a wallet!
MORTY: Don't worry about it.
JERRY: What're you gonna do?
MORTY: What's the difference, we'll figure something out.
HELEN: (to Jerry) You're not paying.
(Jerry releases his grip, allowing a triumphant Morty to take the check.)
JERRY: Alright, fine. You figure something out. I'd be very curious to know how you pick up a check with no money. 'Cause if this works, the whole monetary system's obsolete, we're back to wampum. (standing) I'm going to the bathroom.
(Jerry walks away. Morty reads the check, with Helen leaning to read it too.)
MORTY: How the hell am I gonna pay for this?
[Restaurant Bathroom]
(Jerry enters, to find Leo washing his hands. Leo notices Jerry in the mirror. )
LEO: They give you some portion here, huh?
JERRY: Uh, yeah. (broaching a subject) Hey uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't uh, rude to you that day I bumped into you on the street. Uh, I really did have to get to a meeting.
LEO: (preening himself in the mirror) Aw, no, no, I understand. I got plenty of friends in showbusiness. I know you're all very busy.
JERRY: So you found that watch in the garbage can, huh?
LEO: Yeah. In fact it was right after I ran into you.
JERRY: Oh, heh. You know, a friend of mine has a watch just like that. I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.
LEO: Well, I haven't seen too many like (indicating watch) these.
(Leo begins to head for the door. Jerry walks backwards, keeping pace with him.)
JERRY: Yeah, I know. Maybe uh, you wanna sell me that one.
LEO: (sarcastic) Aww, sure. (laughter)
(Leo opens the door and begins to exit. Jerry grabs him by the arm.)
JERRY: (pulling Leo back in) Hang on a second. I got a little proposition for you.
[Apartment Building Lobby]
(A uniformed doorman is on the phone to a tenant, while a nervous George stands beside him.)
DOORMAN: (into phone) There's a George Bonanza to see you.
GEORGE: Costanza. Costanza.
DOORMAN: (into phone) George Costanza.
GEORGE: The guy who pitched him the show with the stories about nothing. (snaps fingers) Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
DOORMAN: (into phone) Seinfeld friend. (he listens) (to George) He says, call him Monday.
(A desperate George grabs the phone, and the doorman's hand, and pulls it down so's he can speak into it. )
GEORGE: (into phone, frantic) Mister Dalrimple! Mister Dalrimple I have to talk to you!
DOORMAN: Excuse me.
GEORGE: It's about the show. It... No, it was...
DOORMAN: Excuse me.
GEORGE: ...It was all a terrible misunderstanding, sir. Just five minutes. Just five minutes of your time. (listens) Thank you! Thank you, Mister Dalrimple.
(George releases his grip on the phone, and indicates the doorman should listen to it. Keeping a wary eye on George, he does.)
DOORMAN: (into phone) Very good, sir.
(A happier George slaps the doorman on the shoulder and heads toward Russell Dalrimple's apartment.)
[Restaurant]
(Morty stands, explaining his predicament to the maitre d', who speaks with an approximate French accent.)
MORTY: You don't understand. I can't allow my son to pay for me. Look, as soon as I get back to Florida, I promise you I'll mail you a check.
MAITRE D': Why don't you just let him pay, and then you can pay him back?
MORTY: No, no, he won't let me do that.
MAITRE D': Why don't you just put the money in his pants pocket, unsuspectingly?
MORTY: He could wash them.
MAITRE D': Monsieur, we are running a reputable business.
MORTY: Don't tell me about business! I sold raincoats for thirty-five years!
MAITRE D': Aha, but you did not give them away, did you?
MORTY: You don't understand my...
MAITRE D': Ah, monsieur, I cannot get involved with you and your family, ah.
[Street Corner]
Kramer and Elaine stroll to the entrance of Dr Reston's building.
ELAINE: Now look, don't take too long.
KRAMER: (looking around) Look at this building. What is this?
ELAINE: I don't know. It's a building.
KRAMER: (indicating) The door's on a diagonal.
ELAINE: So what?
KRAMER: (looking around) It's architecturally incorrect.
ELAINE: (frustrated) Just go.
(Kramer opens the door and begins to enter. Elaine waves him goodbye, then wonders why she's doing that and gives up.)
[Russell Dalrimple's Apartment]
(Russell has opened the door to an anxious George. In the background is a set dinner table, at which sits Cynthia, Russell's beautiful date. She looks haughty and bored throughout the scene.)
GEORGE: (sidling in) Is this a bad time? I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
RUSSELL: We were about to sit down to dinner.
(George motions he's sorry, but makes no effort to leave.)
RUSSELL: (indicating) This is Cynthia.
GEORGE: (entering the apartment more fully) Oh. Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. (peering at the table) What're you having, veal?
RUSSELL: No.
GEORGE: Looks like veal.
RUSSELL: It's not veal.
GEORGE: Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. (laughs nervously) Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? (indicating) Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken. (tries hard to elicit a laugh)
RUSSELL: Who gave you my address?
GEORGE: No, that's a fair question. It is, uhm... (nervous chuckle) Jerry, yeah. (to Cynthia) Jerry's a friend of mine. (to Russell) He uh, he gave it to me. Unbelievable how many addresses of people this guy has.
(Russell closes the door.)
GEORGE: He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go to Marlon Brando's house if I really wanted.
(Cynthia rises and slinks past George toward the living room area.)
GEORGE: Course, I wouldn't, I mean uh, the guy is uh, well obviously (to Cynthia, as she passes) the guy has his problems.
RUSSELL: So, what's the surprise? You wanna talk about the show?
(Cynthia sits on the couch, and puts her wine glass on the coffee table. As George speaks, Russell crosses to the coffee table, picks up the glass and puts down a coaster, before sitting the glass on it.)
GEORGE: Well, you know, it's really very funny, because you know what we got here, really? We really, really, just have a terrible misunderstanding. You see, when I passed on the deal, I thought that's what Jerry wanted me to say. Y'know, I, I misinterpreted.
CYNTHIA: (bored) Russell, where's the TV Guide.
GEORGE: Oh, what time is it? Eight thirty? I'll tell you what's on. You got Major Dad, Blossom, very funny programme...
RUSSELL: Blossom's on Monday.
GEORGE: Are you sure? Oh, look who I'm talking to. The president of NBC. (forced laughter)
RUSSELL: Look Mister Costanza, it's too late now anyway. I already made a deal with another writing team.
GEORGE: (worried) Alright, alright. Look, we're people, you and me, huh?  Businessmen. Colleagues, if I may. Let's not quibble. We'll do it for the thirteen thousand. Thirteen thousand, and I never came up here, we never talked, alright. You take good care. (moving past Russell toward the door) It was nice seeing you again, and nice meeting you. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, right?
(George is opening the door.)
RUSSELL: Alright, now look. These deals are already made.
(George closes the door and turns back to Russell.)
GEORGE: Awright, lemme just say this. Ten thousand dollars, alright, and now I'm going below what you wanted to pay. You have your dinner, have your veal, or whatever it is. Enjoy...
(George opens the door, and is halfway through.)
RUSSELL: Mister Costanza.
(George re-enters again.)
GEORGE: Alright, that's it. Alright, good, eight thousand dollars. (to Cynthia) Cynthia, again, nice meeting you. Have I commented on the shoes? I love suede, it's so thick and rich. Did you ever, you ever rub it against the grain? Alright, anyway...
(George is halfway through the door again.)
CYNTHIA: (bored, frustrated) Russell, can we eat?
RUSSELL: (to George) Alright. Eight thousand.
GEORGE: (pleased) You've made Jerry very happy.
(George exits and Russell closes the door firmly. As Russell returns to Cynthia, there is a tentative tap at the door. Russell opens it, to reveal George.)
GEORGE: May I just use your bathroom for a moment?
[Restaurant Bathroom]
(Leo and Jerry are mid-negotiation over the watch.)
JERRY: Alright, two hundred, but that's as high as I can go. I really think you're being unreasonable here!
LEO: Jerry, I'd give you the watch. It's not the money, I happen to like it.
JERRY: Look, I happen to know how much that watch cost. It's a sixty dollar watch, you paid forty to get it fixed. That's a hundred dollars. I'm offering you two hundred!
LEO: (indicating) I've never seen a band like this.
JERRY: Aww, right. Three hundred, plus fifty for the repair. Three fifty, that's it!
LEO: You have it on you?
JERRY: Yeah, I think I do.
(Jerry fetches out his wallet.)
JERRY: (under his breath) This is unbelievable.
(Jerry begins handing over a wad of bills to Leo. The door to the bathroom opens and Morty enters.)
MORTY: What the hell is going on here?
[Dr Reston's Office]
(On the street outside, Elaine waits, while upstairs Kramer introduces himself to Dr Reston.)
KRAMER: Well, it uh, (offering his hand) it's a pleasure to meet you.
RESTON: (shaking hands) Thank you for coming in.
KRAMER: Thank you.
RESTON: Please, sit down.
(Dr Reston sits in one of a pair of leather armchairs which face each other, he crosses his legs.)
KRAMER: (quiet) Okay.
(Kramer sits and the leather of the chair makes a series of embarrassing rumbles and squeaks, with more of the same as he emulates Dr Reston's crossed legs sitting position.)
RESTON: Could I offer you something to drink. Uhm, coffee? Anything?
KRAMER: Okay uh, yeah. I'll have a uh, you have a decaf cappuccino?
RESTON: I don't think we have that.
KRAMER: Well, that's a little strange.
RESTON: Uh, why does that surprise you?
KRAMER: Well, it's uh, it's a very popular drink
RESTON: This is an office.
KRAMER: That's true. But, you know, I can't help but think that uh...
RESTON: (interrupting) So tell me Mister Kramer...
KRAMER: ...Okay, yes, shoot.
RESTON: Tell me all about uh, you and Elaine.
KRAMER: Oh, alrighty uh...
(He moves in his seat, resulting in another digestive tract rumble from the leather)
KRAMER: Well, what we have here, doctor, is uhm, an extraordinary situation.
RESTON: Is it?
KRAMER: Oh, you better believe it.
[Street Corner]
(Elaine is waiting outside for Kramer. Along the street strolls Joe Davola, singing as he goes.)
DAVOLA: (singing) '...Travelling along...'
(Elaine recognises the tune, and joins in.)
ELAINE/DAVOLA: '...singing a song, side by side...'
(Davola stops and looks at Elaine. He looks like he likes what he sees, and Elaine seems interested too. They flirt.)
ELAINE: Wow. You really have a terrible voice.
DAVOLA: Do I know you?
ELAINE: Uhh, I don't think so.
DAVOLA: 'Cos you really look familiar.
ELAINE: Oh, well maybe you've seen me. My face is on uhm, Mount
Rushmore.
DAVOLA: Oh yes, of course, that's it. I guess I'm just used to seeing it on a much larger scale.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, right. I replaced uh, Teddy Roosevelt.
DAVOLA: Oh really.
ELAINE: Umm. Trustbuster. Bust this.
(They laugh and smile at each other.)
[Dr. Reston's Office]
(Kramer and Dr Reston are also laughing.)
KRAMER: You know, I never thought of it like that before, doctor. (points) You, are absolutely right.
RESTON: I'm glad we agree.
KRAMER: (reaching in pocket) Hey, would you like a cigar? Y'know, they're Cubans.
RESTON: I'd love one.
(Kramer hands over a cigar and fetches a match from his pocket.)
KRAMER: Yeah. You know, I think Elaine is a wonderful woman. You two are gonna make a wonderful couple.
(Kramer strikes a match on the sole of his shoe.)
RESTON: If you ever feel, a need to talk to someone...
KRAMER: (lighting Dr Reston's cigar) Uh huh.
RESTON: ...About anything. You have my number.
KRAMER: (lighting his own cigar) Well, that's very kind of you.
(Kramer puts down the match, not noticing he's placed it on a box of tissues. He and Dr Reston puff contentedly at their cigars.)
KRAMER: Mmm, these are good, huh?
(Kramer notices he's set light to the top tissue in the box.)
KRAMER: (quiet) Oh.
(Kramer pulls the smouldering tissue from the box. He shakes it to put out the fire, but a piece falls to the floor. As he reaches for it, he keeps the rest of the tissue in his hand, where it burns his fingers. He jumps, almost dropping his cigar, and sucks at his burned digits.)
[Street Corner]
(Elaine is using Davola's back as a rest as she jots her number on a piece of paper.)
ELAINE: I cannot believe I'm doing this. I never meet people like this. You're not a nut, are you?
DAVOLA: No, I don't think so.
(Elaine hands the piece of paper and the pen back to Davola as they laugh at the ludicrous possibility that he might be a nut.)
[Restaurant]
(Naomi is handing her card to Jerry.)
JERRY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I never do stuff like this.
NAOMI: (joking) Really? I give out my number to just about every customer who comes in here.
JERRY: Oh. (chuckles) Really? You don't seem that desperate.
NAOMI: (playing it straight) Oh yeah. Actually, I'm a little disappointed. I kind of had my eye on uncle Leo.
JERRY: Uh huh. Well uh, I'll give you a call, and thanks for the fish. By the way, you know why fish are so thin?
NAOMI: Why?
JERRY: They eat fish.
(Naomi starts to laugh at his joke. It is, of course, the laugh later described as 'Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer'. It's loud and persistent. Jerry leaves, but then leans back around the corner with a look of disbelief on his face.)
[Lobby In Dr. Reston's Office]
(A cheerful Joe Davola waits for the elevator to arrive, whistling 'Side By Side'. The elevator arrives with a ding of the bell. The door opens and Kramer steps out, shielded from Davola by other passengers. Kramer walks away, relighting his cigar, as Davola enters the elevator, still whistling happily.)
[Street Corner]
(Elaine sits on the steps outside the building. The door opens and one of the other elevator passengers exits, he releases the door, which swings shut, almost striking Kramer. Kramer walks toward Elaine.)
KRAMER: Hey.
ELAINE: What happened? What took you so long?
KRAMER: Hey, he's a terrific guy.
ELAINE: Wha...? What are you talking about? What'd he say?
KRAMER: Well, we talked about a lot of things.
(The camera pans up, toward the lighted window of Dr Reston's office.)
ELAINE (O.C.): You talked about a lot of things? Well...
KRAMER (O.C.): Yeah.
ELAINE (O.C.): Did you talk about us?
(Elaine and Kramer's voices fade out, and the voices inside the window fade up.)
DAVOLA (O.C.): I'm in love. I just met her outside in the street. Her
name's Elaine. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
RESTON (O.C.): Did you say Elaine?
[Middle Monologue]
JERRY: How come the psychiatrist, every, the hour is only fifty minutes? Wha, what do they do with that ten minutes that they have left? Do they just sit there going, "Boy, that guy was crazy. I couldn't believe the things he was saying. What a nut! Who's coming in next? Oh, no, another headcase!"
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry brings his parents' cases from the bedroom. Helen is finishing packing.)
MORTY: You shoulda told me it didn't work.
JERRY: I know, I know.
HELEN: You didn't have to throw it out.
JERRY: I was always late. It was frustrating me. I'm sorry, I really am.
(The buzzer sounds.)
HELEN: Oh, that must be Leo.
JERRY: I woulda taken you to the airport.
HELEN: He has nothing to do.
JERRY: Neither do I. (to intercom) Yeah?
GEORGE (O.S.): It's George.
JERRY: Come on up. (to parents) It's George.
MORTY: Oh, it's George.
HELEN: What ever happened with NBC and the deal?
JERRY: Ah, George turned it down.
HELEN: He turned it down?
JERRY: Yeah.
HELEN: Why did he do that?
JERRY: Because of Ted Danson.
HELEN: What does Ted Danson have to do with it?
MORTY: Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.
JERRY: (fetching a drink from the fridge) Hey, who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting more money.
(George enters.)
GEORGE: (to Jerry) Hey.
MORTY: Hey, Georgie-boy, how are ya?
GEORGE: Hey, Mr Seinfeld. (shakes Morty's hand) Hey, Mrs Seinfeld. How are you?
(He approaches Helen for a greeting.)
HELEN: What's the matter with you?
GEORGE: What'd I do?
JERRY: What about NBC? Did you hear anything?
GEORGE: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
(Jerry looks expectantly, but George makes him wait.)
GEORGE: We got a deal.
(There is an outpouring of jubilation and congratulations aimed at George.)
MORTY/HELEN/JERRY: (simultaneous) Hey!/That's wonderful!/We got a deal!
JERRY: Heyy! Terrific.
MORTY: You see, he had the right idea. Hold out. That's how you get the big money, huh George? (slaps George on the shoulder)
GEORGE: Uh, please, Morty.
MORTY: No, no, no. He knows how to talk to these people. No-one's gonna take advantage of Georgie. (slaps George's shoulder again)
GEORGE: I'm just happy to be working with your talented son...
JERRY: Aww...
GEORGE: ...Who's not doing this for the money.
JERRY: ...C'mon.
GEORGE: You have no idea how refreshing that is.
JERRY: So what'd we get?
GEORGE: (big smile) Eight thousand dollars.
JERRY: Beautiful!
GEORGE: (quietly) That's uh, for the two of us.
HELEN: Four thousand apiece?
JERRY: Lemme see if I understand this. In other words, you held out
for... less money.
GEORGE: I was wrong, you were right.
JERRY: You know, the basic idea of negotiation, as I understand it, is to get your price to go... up.
GEORGE: You're smart, I'm dumb.
JERRY: You know, this is how they negotiate in the bizarro world.
(The buzzer sounds.)
HELEN: That's gotta be Leo.
JERRY: (to intercom) Yeah?
LEO (O.C.): Leo.
JERRY: Alright, we're coming down.
MORTY: Alright, let's get going.
JERRY: Dad, before we go, I got a little something for you.
(Jerry fetches a small package from the kitchen drawer and offers it to Morty.)
JERRY: A present.
MORTY: A present?
(Morty opens it.)
MORTY: Hey! Look at this, a wallet. Exactly what I needed, y'see.
JERRY: C'mon, you lost your wallet, I figured I'd get you another one.
HELEN: I hope you didn't spend too much on that.
MORTY: I wanna tell you. This is one of the most thoughtful gifts anyone's ever given me.
HELEN: He's something, you son, isn't he?
JERRY: Ah hah, alright, let's go.
(Everyone begins to head for the door.)
MORTY: You're a terrific kid.
(Jerry picks up a case.)
JERRY: Okay.
GEORGE: Yeah, he's something, isn't he?
(George picks up the other case, as Morty and Helen exit.)
HELEN: How could anybody not like you?
GEORGE: (to Jerry) You're very special.
JERRY: (pointedly) Yeah, I'm good for about four thousand dollars.
[Street]
(Uncle Leo has the trunk of his car open and looks impatient.)
LEO: Hey, let's go! It's twelve (checks watch) uh, twelve twenty-two.
MORTY: Alright, Leo.
JERRY: Hey, uncle Leo.
LEO: Hi, hi...
JERRY: How you doing?
(There are murmurs of greetings.)
JERRY: This is some beautiful parking spot you got here.
LEO: Yeah, I hate to give it up.
JERRY: Yeah. Hey, dad, you sure you don't need any more money?
MORTY: Jerry!
JERRY: Alright, I'm just joking. Listen, have a nice trip.
HELEN: (hugging Jerry) Bye bye, Jerry.
GEORGE: Bye Mrs Seinfeld, take care.
MORTY: Bye bye. (hugging Jerry) Thanks again for the wallet.
GEORGE: (shaking hands with Morty) Morty, always a pleasure.
JERRY: Take care now. So long.
(Jerry and George walk away to cross the street back to the apartment. They speak quietly, so's Helen and Morty don't overhear.)
GEORGE: Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.
JERRY: Oh, he took it. I put four hundred dollars in the new wallet.
GEORGE: You're kidding.
JERRY: He lost all that cash. It was the only way I could give it back to him, otherwise he wouldn't accept it.
GEORGE: Man, would I like to see the look on his face.
(Jerry gives a final wave to his parents. They wave back.)
MORTY: You believe this?
HELEN: What?
MORTY: (indicates the new wallet) It's velcro.
HELEN: You're kidding.
MORTY: Who needs this?
(He tosses the wallet into the trash bin.)
MORTY: Leo, let's go.
(Morty and Helen climb into Leo's car. Leo closes the trunk and walks toward the driver's door. He stops, as something catches his eye. Leo picks the wallet out of the trash, looks around to see if anyone's watching, and tucks it into his pocket as he goes to get in the car.)
[Closing Monologue]
JERRY: ...main difference between the women's wallet and the man's wallet, is the photo section. True? Women carry with them a photograph of every person they've ever met, every day in their whole lives, since the beginning of time. And every picture is out of date. You know what I mean? It's, "Here's my cousin, three years old. She's in the marines now." "This is my dog. He died during the Johnson administration." You know. You get stopped by a cop, no licence, no registration, (waves imaginary wallet) "Here's fifty-six people that know me." Cop goes. "Alright, ma'am, just wanted to make sure you had some friends, move it along. Routine pal check."
Comedy club - Jerry on stage with the opening monologue
JERRY: Have you ever called someone up, and you're disappointed when they answer the phone?  You wanted the machine.  You know, and you're always kind of thrown off, (left hand up to side of face, pretending its a receiver) you go "Oh, I eh, I - I didn't know you were there, I ah - just wanted to leave a message saying, sorry I missed you."
So here what we have is two people who hate each other, don't really ever want to talk, but the phone machine is like this relationship respirator keeping these marginal brain dead relationships alive.  And we all do it -- Why? So that when we come home, you can see that little flashing red light.  You go "all right, messages."  You see, people need that.  It's very important for human beings to feel they are popular and well liked amongst a large group of people that we don't care for.
Stock shot of Hunan Chinese restaurant at night
(Jerry and Naomi enter Jerry's apartment)
JERRY: Well this is it.
NAOMI: Oh, this is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.
JERRY: Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that garlic.
NAOMI: Yeah, me too.
JERRY: No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things were garlic. I thought they were peanuts.
NAOMI: (laughs) - Nnnhhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think Naked Gun is on. Oh I've seen it. I laughed through that whole thing. You wanna watch?
JERRY: No, I mean, I don't think so.
NAOMI: I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy go lucky.
JERRY: No, no, no. I'm not happy, I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything I'm sad stop unlucky.
NAOMI: Ahahahahahahahahaha.
JERRY: That's not funny Naomi.
NAOMI: Ah hahahaha. (points at Jerry)
JERRY: I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.
(Jerry goes over to the answering machine and plays the message, then walks back over to the kitchen to get a drink from his bottled water.  Naomi sits on the couch looking through the TV Guide, also listening to George's message)
GEORGE: (on the answering machine) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set for the weekend. This is going to be great. You're going to have a great time with Naomi.
(Naomi smiles. Jerry takes a sip of water)
GEORGE: (con't) All right, you know she's got that laugh. What did you say? It's like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
(Naomi stops reading, looks up, pondering what George just said.  Jerry puts down his water and sprints over to the machine)
GEORGE: (con't) A-Anyway, I was thinking we would take two cars up to the cabin and that way if one of wanted to stay you know...
(Jerry trying to stop the tape -- he rips the answering machine out of the wall plug)
JERRY: This thing has never worked right. (holding the machine in his hand)
NAOMI: You think I, laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer?
JERRY: Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved internationally known cartoon characters of all time. "I'm going to kill that cwazy wabbit ... hahahahahaaa " Come on. Not only that, a juicer is one of the healthiest ways ... (Naomi exits) it makes the juice ... it extracts the-the pulp and-and-and the vitamins, for-for long life and-and-and vitality.
[in Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: How could you leave a message like that on my machine.?
GEORGE: Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
JERRY: Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
GEORGE: Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.
JERRY: Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.
GEORGE: What do you mean not goin'? Come on, we got plans here. Call her up.
JERRY: Nah, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a girl with a laugh like that? I mean izz-it's like ah, it's like Coco Chanel goin' out with a fish monger. You know, cause she's with all the perfumes and a fish monger's pretty bad smell.
GEORGE: Wh-Well maybe you should ask Elaine.
JERRY: Yeah but if I ask Elaine, then Kramer will feel slighted.
GEORGE: Oh no no no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand him. He vomited all over her.
JERRY: Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?
(Kramer enters smoking a cigar)
KRAMER: Hmm.
JERRY: Ah, Kramer.
KRAMER: Hello boys, (in an Irish accent) top of the morning to ya. What do you say?
What do ya be?
JERRY: Will you put that thing out before you start another fire. You had to give him a box of cigars.
KRAMER: So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?
JERRY and GEORGE: uh uh, we're uh ..
KRAMER: Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.
JERRY: Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
KRAMER: Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.
JERRY: and GEORGE: Ye, hu, um Ye,
KRAMER: Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend.  Ffoooo (Taking an imaginary swing, he makes the sound of a golf ball being hit)
GEORGE: Gee, that's-that's too bad.
JERRY: Yeah, too bad.
KRAMER: Why? What wa?
GEORGE: Well, cause we were just saying we were going to ask you to come up to the country with us this weekend.  Susan's father has a cabin up there.  But, eh, all right, well.
KRAMER: Well, what, they got any golf courses up there?
JERRY and GEORGE: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
GEORGE: No, no that's ah, that's pie country.
JERRY: Yeah
GEORGE: Yeah, they eh, they do a lot of baking up there.
KRAMER: Uh huh.
JERRY: They sell them by the side of the road.  Blueberry, Blackberry ....
GEORGE: Blackberry, Boysenberry ...
JERRY: Boysenberry, Huckleberry ...
GEORGE: Huckleberry, Raspberry...
JERRY: Raspberry, Strawberry ...
GEORGE: Strawberry, Cranberry ...
JERRY: Peach.
(MONKS)
ELAINE: I don't know.
JERRY: Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. If you're there it'll be a better group.
ELAINE: What's that?
JERRY: Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I never know what to write on these things. I hate doin' this.
ELAINE: "I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed caus' its like a dry cleaner?
JERRY: Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to go?
ELAINE: Well what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!
JERRY: Well, um same bed ...
ELAINE: uh huh (very quietly)
JERRY: .. and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.
ELAINE: What about me?
JERRY: Well you'd be naked of course.
ELAINE: Uh, that's, ...
MEL: Excuse me, Jerry Seinfeld?
JERRY: Yeah.
MEL: My name's Sanger, Mel Sanger.
JERRY: Hi.
MEL: I drive that truck out there.
JERRY: Oh, the Yoo Hoo?
MEL: Yeah.
JERRY: I love Yoo Hoo.
MEL: Yes, it's a fine product. Anyway I saw you on the Tonight Show a couple weeks ago. I was watching the show with my son Donald. He's got this rare immune deficiency in his blood ... the damnedest thing. Doctors say he has to live in a plastic bubble. Can you imagine that? A bubble.
JERRY: A bubble?
ELAINE: A bubble?
MEL: Yes, a bubble!
MEL: Do you mind? May I?
ELAINE: Oh, sure.
(Mel sits down with them)
MEL: Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. And I'm out there six days a week haulin' Yoo Hoo. We have sacrificed everything. All for the sake of our little ... bubble boy.
(breaks up in tears)
MEL: (in tears) Excuse me, I ah ...
ELAINE: Oh right here (giving out paper napkins to Mel and Jerry and herself)
(MEL AND ELAINE WIPE TEARS FROM THEIR EYES, JERRY WIPES CRUMBS FROM HIS MOUTH and picks his teeth at the corner of his mouth)
MEL: Excuse me, anyway we were watching ya on TV.
JERRY: You get in the bubble with him?
MEL: No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic.
JERRY: Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
MEL: No, it's clear.
JERRY: Ah ha.
ELAINE: Who has the remote?  (wipes a tear from her eye)
MEL: He does.
ELAINE: The remote goes through the bubble?
MEL: Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote.
JERRY: So you have no control over the remote?
MEL: No, it's frustrating.
JERRY: Mmm
ELAINE: Yeah, of course, yeah. (blows her nose)
MEL: So anyway, you're his favorite comedian. He laughed so hard the other night we had to give him an extra shot of hemoglobin.
JERRY: Awe... That's nice!
MEL: Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit and, just say hello.
JERRY: Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...
ELAINE: Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.
JERRY: Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where da ya - where do you live, uh, up town? Upper west side?
MEL: No, up state.
JERRY: Up state! Hummm.
(Jerry's apartment)
JERRY: He's a bubble boy.
GEORGE: A bubble boy?
JERRY: Yes. A bubble boy.
SUSAN: What's a bubble boy?
JERRY: He lives in a bubble.
GEORGE: Boy!
SUSAN: Say, so what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?
JERRY: No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big piece of plastic dividing the room.
SUSAN: Oh.
GEORGE: What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think like that dry cleaning plastic?
JERRY: That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. Anyway what can I do, I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.  It's his birthday. I can't go to the cabin.
SUSAN: Well, where does he live?
JERRY: I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'
SUSAN: Wait a minute, This is right on the way to the cabin.
GEORGE: Well all right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.
JERRY: You think we can do it?
SUSAN: Oh I know exactly where this is. You can just follow us.
JERRY: Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.
GEORGE: (laughs) hu hu.
SUSAN: I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather built it in 1947. It's it's incredible.
JERRY: Ohh.
GEORGE: All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, we'll see you tomorrow.
JERRY: OK.
(Kramer enters with golf bag, clubs and outfit, smoking a cigar)
KRAMER: Well,
GEORGE: and JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice.
(Susan recoils at his presence)
KRAMER: Well, I'm off to the links.
GEORGE: and JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm sorry I can't make it.
GEORGE: (clears his throat)
SUSAN: The what?
GEORGE: Uh, nothing, lets get going. Come on. (laughs) hu hu.
SUSAN: Did you ...  (George grabs her hand)
GEORGE: No, no, no we'll talk about it later.
SUSAN: Is that one of the cigars my father gave you?  (Susan is pulled from the apt. and Kramer looks out the door to watch them leave)
(2 cars on the road George leading, Jerry following --)
(IN Jerry's car on highway)
ELAINE: Hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like her?
JERRY: Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.?
ELAINE: Oh, that's nice!
JERRY: What's he doing? What is his hurry?
(George's car pulls away at a high rate of speed)
ELAINE: Well you know George. It's not good enough to get there. You gotta make good time.
JERRY: I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport in 25 minutes.
I-I never heard the end of it
ELAINE: Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
JERRY: Look at him.
ELAINE: Hmhmhm (laughing quietly)
(In George's car)
GEORGE: Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?
SUSAN: Why?
GEORGE:  Knock it off, just sit in your seat over there you're distracting me. We're making incredible time here. I once went into Kennedy Airport from West 81st Street to in uh, in 15 minutes. hu uh.  Oh, here hold this. It's uh, ten dollars for the tolls.
(Jerry's car)
JERRY: What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?
ELAINE: Isn't that blue car him?
JERRY: No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe it. I lost him. That stupid idiot. Now what are we going to do?
ELAINE: It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
JERRY: I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I - I don't even remember the name of the town.
ELAINE: Wa',you don't have the directions?
JERRY: No, I was following him.
ELAINE: How could you not take the directions?
JERRY: Because, HE'S my directions.
(from George's car)
SUSAN: I didn't see them George.
(Jerry ranting in his car)
JERRY: We make all these plans - this idiot goes a hundred miles an hour - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -
ELAINE: Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for you in his bubble, or igloo thing, whatever.
JERRY: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
ELAINE: Here just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.
(from George's car)
SUSAN: We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM!
GEORGE: Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?
SUSAN: Well now what are you gonna do?
GEORGE: It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.
SUSAN: Does he have the address?
(Jerry's apartment - Kramer enters - singing something undeterminable, he picks up a piece of paper from the counter)
JERRY: (answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. Thanks.
NAOMI: (on phone speaker) Hi, Jerry it's Naomi.  Ah, listen, if its not too late I, changed my mind, I'd like to go to the cabin.
KRAMER: Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.
(Kramer's car)
KRAMER: So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?
NAOMI: No.
KRAMER: These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.
NAOMI: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ... Ha haaaa
(Kramer points at her and laughs)
(The Sangers' house, on the front porch)
GEORGE: I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
(Susan smooches him - playfully biting George's right ear lobe)
GEORGE: Would you stop it. (Susan playfully bites his ear lobe again)  Would you quit it please.  Someone is going to see us here.
SUSAN: So what? You are SUCH a prude.
GEORGE: Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. (snapping his fingers 5 times)
SUSAN: Okay, Come on lets go in.
GEORGE: What?
SUSAN: Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might be very late if they make it at all.
GEORGE: I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.
SUSAN: What's the matter?
GEORGE: I-I just don't react well to these situations. My grandmother died two months early because of the way I reacted in the hospital. She was getting' better. And then I went to pay her a visit. She saw my face. BOOM. That was the end of it.
SUSAN: Okay, we're goin' in. Come on.
GEORGE: Susan, wait please... (grabs her)  Please ...
SUSAN: Come on George. George stop. George.
GEORGE: Susan, Susan would you wai,....
(Highway diner)
JERRY: (ranting)  I can't believe how a little thing like George going too fast - and my whole weekend is gone - the plans, the packing, ... everything.
ELAINE: Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?
JERRY: Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have to mention the bubble boy?  I know about the bubble boy. I'm aware of the bubble boy. Why do you keep reminding me about the bubble boy?
(Elaine stares at him and blows a bubble with bubble gum.  The waitress comes up to the counter.)
JERRY: I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.
WAITRESS: How ?bout you?
ELAINE: Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
(the waitress turns and walks away)
JERRY: (whispers) You can't just have water.
ELAINE: Why not? That's all I want.
JERRY: Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in and sit down. It's a business.
(the waitress comes back and pulls out a cup and saucer)
WAITRESS: Hold it a second. Don't ?chu play on TV?
JERRY: Oh, no.
ELAINE: YES! yes. You saw him on TV.
WAITRESS: What's your name?
ELAINE: Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: Elaaaiinne...
WAITRESS: Garry Seinfield! I saw you on the Tonight Show.
ELAINE: Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?
WAITRESS: Oh, ha ha
JERRY: Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.
ELAINE: He's lying. They're in the trunk (takes car keys) Now you get to sign another one.
JERRY: I'm not lying.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah he is. (as she leaves)
JERRY: She'll have a cup of coffee and a broiled chicken.
(Sanger's house)
MRS. SANGER: See it's not really a bubble. A lot of people think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic divider.
GEORGE: Huh (quietly)
GEORGE: and SUSAN: (nod)
(long pause)
GEORGE: Can you uh, go in the bubble?
MRS. SANGER: Well, you have to put so many things on because of the germs.
MEL: The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production.
GEORGE: So then he makes his own bed?
MRS. SANGER: Well, that's one of the things we fight about.
(George points at her, understanding what she is saying)
MEL: Would you like to meet him?
GEORGE: Uh, well, you know,...
MRS. SANGER: Oh, he loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit with him.
DONALD: HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER, I'M GONNA SHOVE IT IN YOUR FACE.
MRS. SANGER: (embarrassed) Ha...ha ha ha ha, ha.
(Highway Diner)
ELAINE: (laughing) hehehe -- One picture left in the trunk.
JERRY: Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! Yeah, this turned out to be a GREAT weekend.
ELAINE: Where's my water?
JERRY: Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.
WAITRESS: Thanks.
ELAINE: Waddya' write?
WAITRESS: "Nothing's finer than being in your diner."
ELAINE: Hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu "Ther - There is nothing finer than being in your diner."?
JERRY: No good?
ELAINE: THIS is what you came up with?
JERRY: Well.
ELAINE: That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.
JERRY: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. Would you mind. I'd like to take the picture back.
WAITRESS: Why
JERRY: I, I'm not happy with what I wrote.
WAITRESS: It's good. I like it.
JERRY: No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with something really funny written on it.
WAITRESS: Well, when you mail me a new one I'll send you back this one.
JERRY: No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.
WAITRESS: RIGHT! (leaves)
(Donald's room)
MRS. SANGER: This is Donald.
GEORGE: Hi. (waves to Donald and laughs) hahahaha.
SUSAN: Hello.
DONALD: WHO ARE YOU? Where's Seinfeld?
MRS. SANGER: He's on his way. These are his friends.
DONALD: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? NEVER SEEN A KID IN A BUBBLE BEFORE?
GEORGE: Tsst...'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... bubble ... you know.  I got a lot of bubble experience. Come on.
DONALD: WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
SUSAN: I-I-I have no story.
GEORGE: She works for NBC.
DONALD: HOW 'BOUT TAKING YOUR TOP OFF?
MRS. SANGER: Donald, behave yourself.
DONALD: COME ON.
MRS. SANGER: I know. I know. Why don't you play a game of Trivial Pursuit?
GEORGE: Ah, well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...
DONALD: Ooo. WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID?
GEORGE: A-hu no, uh, it's just that ...
DONALD: WELL I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
(Highway Diner)
JERRY: Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give it back to me.
WAITRESS: You are really startin' to get under my skin.
JERRY: I want that picture.
WAITRESS: Well, you can't have it! In fact maybe you better just pay your check and get out.
(Elaine digging into the roast chicken)
JERRY: I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.
WAITRESS: Well, you ain't getting' it back.
JERRY: Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
(The waitress hits the picture on the wall with her open hand flush against it)
ELAINE: This chicken is really good.
(Bubble Boy's room - George pulls a Trivial Pursuit card -- The Bubble Boy's right arm ala space suit type arm and a glove at the end to protect him)
DONALD: OK, HISTORY ... THIS IS FOR THE GAME. ... HOW YA DOIN' OVER THERE? ... NOT TOO GOOD!
GEORGE: All right Bubble Boy. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?
DONALD: THAT'S A JOKE. THE MOORS.
GEORGE: Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer is, The MOOPS.
DONALD: MOOPS? LET ME SEE THAT. THAT'S NOT MOOPS YOU JERK, IT'S MOORS. IT'S A MISPRINT.
GEORGE: I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.
DONALD: IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S MOORS. THERE'S NO, MOOPS.
GEORGE: It's MOOPS.
DONALD: MOORS.
GEORGE: MOOPS,
DONALD: MOORS!
(The cabin)
KRAMER: Hey!  Anybody home?  Oh boy.
NAOMI: What should we do?
KRAMER: Ah, hold these (boxes of) pies.
(Kramer opens a window by the front door of the cabin)
KRAMER: Okay.
( Kramer falls in through the open window knocking over a bunch of stuff)
(Donald's room)
GEORGE: Help, someone. (BUBBLE BOY is strangling George)
DONALD: THERE'S NO MOOPS. YOU IDIOT.
SUSAN: Stop it. Let go of him!
Mrs. SANGER: Donald, stop it! Now, let go of him Donald. Donald!
DONALD: I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.
GEORGE: You're choking me.
Mrs. SANGER: Donald, ... Donald...
DONALD: MOORS. SAY MOORS!
GEORGE: MOOPS, MOOPS
Mrs. SANGER: Donald, No. ... Donald, stop it ..
(Susan bursts the bubble)
(hissing sound and Donald's hands leave George's throat)
(Highway Diner)
(Waitress is strangling Jerry, the cook is grabbing Jerry, Elaine is grabbing the cook)
JERRY: What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!
WAITRESS: Are you going to pay for that?
JERRY: No, I want the picture back.
(angry guy enters)
MAN #1: Something's happened to the Bubble Boy. They're rushing him to the hospital.
WAITRESS: What? (releases Jerry)
JERRY: The Bubble Boy? He lives around here?
MAN #1: That's his house right down the road.
MAN #2: He got in a fight with some guy.
Guy1: What kind of person would hurt the Bubble Boy?
MAN #2: Some little bald guy from the city.
MAN #1: Come on -- Vern, Page, Preston, don't you think we ought to do somethin'?
(Elaine and Jerry make their escape)
(The cabin)
KRAMER: Naomi, come on let's get goin'.
(Kramer is smoking a Cuban cigar and testing a fishing rod and reel)
NAOMI: But that lake must be freezing.
(Kramer sets his burning cigar on the mantle above the fireplace)
KRAMER: Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.
(Kramer casts the fishing pole away and pulls it back in -- it hits him in the face, startling himself.  Naomi enters in a blue robe with a couple of towels -- she tosses one to Kramer, which he does not catch.)
NAOMI: Ready to go swimming?
KRAMER: Let's go.... OK. (he snaps the towel at Naomi's backside)  GOTCHA.
NAOMI: AHAaaaaaha
KRAMER: HeYAWaaa
(Kramer pulls the door behind them as they run out -- Camera shot of the lit cigar -- it falls from the mantle onto a pile of newspapers -- either from the vibration of the door being closed or the vacuum of air being created that causes the cigar to fall -- either way, the cigar was placed on the mantle in a precarious position.)
(The Sanger house)
(George stands in the open front door.  The emergency lights can be seen flashing in the reflection of the window -- he motions with both hands to Susan lets go? She comes out the door and he puts his hand to her back as a slight gesture as the walk down the few steps)
GEORGE: JERRY! What happened to you?
JERRY: What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles an hour.
GEORGE: Oh I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was tried to kill me.
(Mel Sanger and his wife exit the house and head off camera towards the emergency vehicles.)
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Yeah, Susan tell him.
SUSAN: It's a long story.
GEORGE: Yeah.
(Two emergency med. techs. pulling a stretcher on wheels out the door with Donald the Bubble Boy? on it. They stop so he can talk to the group.)
DONALD: HEY SEINFELD!
JERRY: Hey, Happy Birthday.
ELAINE: Hi.
DONALD: THANKS FOR SHOWING UP. YOU KNOW YOUR FRIEND HERE TRIED TO KILL ME.
GEORGE: Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya' you little twerp?
DONALD: MOORS
GEORGE: MOOPS
DONALD: MOORS
GEORGE: MOOPS
DONALD: MOORS
GEORGE: MOOPS
(The towns people arrive - about 10 of them)
MAN #1: There's the guy who tried to kill the Bubble Boy. Get him!
GEORGE: Go, go, get out, ...
(Our heroes scrambling -- they run for it)
(Night shot of a fire truck racing down the road, passing cars, sirens blasting, lights flashing)
(Jerry's car -- Jerry's and Elaine)
JERRY: Fire engines?
(Jerry looks as the fire truck passes his car)
(George's car -- Susan looks tired as her head is on the head rest -- she rolls her head to the side to glance at the fire truck cruising by)
GEORGE: What? Must be a big one.
(Night shot -- In the woods, a smoky haze, backlit with streams of blue light and smoke through the trees)
ELAINE: Do you smell something?
JERRY: Yeah,
SUSAN: Smoke.
GEORGE: Yeah, (cough) Definite smoke.
ELAINE: Arghhh, look it's a fire! (cough)
(They emerge from the woods -- Susan first carrying a flashlight and a red bag, George with a bag of groceries, Elaine and Jerry follow  -- they stand looking at the burning cabin)
(Night shot of the cabin burning)
JERRY: Holy cow! look at that!
SUSAN: IT'S MY FATHER'S CABIN!
ELAINE: The CABIN is on fire!
GEORGE: (Apprehensively) Um. I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from the tolls.
ELAINE: How could this have happened?
(Kramer and Naomi arrive wearing their robes, with the towels over their shoulders)
KRAMER: (singing) ... It's a big, wild, funky mountain man ...
NAOMI: Oh, my god, the cabin?
JERRY: What are you two doin' here?
NAOMI: Look at that.
(Night shot of the cabin burning)
JERRY: You didn't ... (makes motion like he's lighting a cigar)
KRAMER: My Cubans!  (runs off to the burning cabin)
[Jerry on stage - Closing monologue]
Something very scary and exciting about fire, ah people always run to see a fire. They're very proud, if they have a fireplace.  And I think that's what smoking is really all about.  That's the power of smoke it's just this thing (pretends to be smoking) -- ?I got fire right here in my hand. Smoke and fire is literally, coming right out of my mouth.?
And it's very intimidating to the non-smoker, ?cause it's like talking to someone that's going my head could open up, lava could explode out, pour right down my face, doesn't bother me a bit.
And then a cigar is even worse -- I mean a cigar, is like -- you think this end is bad, look at this wet, disgusting, chewed up nub huh -- How scary is that??
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George enter with some plastic bags)
JERRY: She hasn't told her father yet?
GEORGE: No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
JERRY: "We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?
GEORGE: Susan wants me to be there.
JERRY: You're meetin' the father for the first time?
GEORGE: (Reluctantly) Yeah.
JERRY: (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.
GEORGE: I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
JERRY: (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..
GEORGE: Yeah, I know what happened.
JERRY: No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..
GEORGE: (Getting frustrated) I know.
JERRY: (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..
GEORGE: Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.
JERRY: (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.
GEORGE: (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..
JERRY: (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.
GEORGE: We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
JERRY: (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.
GEORGE: (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?
JERRY: What, you got a problem with the pen now?
GEORGE: Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.
JERRY: Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.
GEORGE: (Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?
JERRY: (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.
GEORGE: (Offering) Drink?
JERRY: No, no thank you.
GEORGE: (Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.
JERRY: Act I, Scene A..
(A long pause as they both attempt to start writing passes)
GEORGE: Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
JERRY: (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?
(Scene cuts to Elaine's office. She's waving a pencil around in her free hand)
ELAINE: Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go. (Hangs up) Sandra! Sandra? Hi, can you come here for a second?
(Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment)
JERRY: Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)
GEORGE: Alright, here we go. You got it?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Here we go.
JERRY: Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.
GEORGE: (Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?
(A long pause, then the scene jumps back to Elaine and Sandra)
ELAINE: Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could you not talk to them for too long?
SANDRA: Why? Did Jerry say something?
ELAINE: No, no.
SANDRA: He must have said something.
ELAINE: Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
SANDRA: (Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. (Exits quickly)
ELAINE: (Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right now. It's very hard being a stand-up comedian! Sometimes they don't laugh!
(Scene goes back to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George are sleeping. Kramer slams his apartment door shut, waking both of them up)
GEORGE: Alright, let's go.
JERRY: Here we go.
(Both get situated to write as Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey.
GEORGE: yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..
JERRY: Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?
KRAMER: (Complaining) No more golf.
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every time I give him a couple of those Cuban cigars?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: (Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can ask Susan's father for more, huh?
GEORGE: What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!
KRAMER: Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
GEORGE: Kramer, please.
KRAMER: Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass has big brown patches in it, they don't rake the sand traps! Not to mention the caliber of people you have to play with!
GEORGE: Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.
KRAMER: (Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
GEORGE: (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
JERRY: What?!
GEORGE: Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.
JERRY: (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?
GEORGE: I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Ross' house]
(Susan, her parents, and George are all dining)
MRS. ROSS: (To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, Sarah?
MR. ROSS: (Gruff) A slight resemblance.
(George laughs slightly)
MRS. ROSS: (To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
GEORGE: Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..
(Seeing the Ross' expression, he trails off)
MR. ROSS: How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
GEORGE: Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
MR. ROSS: You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
GEORGE: (Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh)
MR. ROSS: What?
SUSAN: (Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy.
MR. ROSS: I didn't care much for his jokes.
SUSAN: (To George) Daddy never laughs.
GEORGE: Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"? What is that? "Ha, ha!"?
MR. ROSS: You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere.
MRS. ROSS: You and your cigars..
MR. ROSS: (Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
SUSAN: Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk to you about..
MR. ROSS: Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?
GEORGE: (Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and Elaine are talking. Jerry's using a harsh tone)
JERRY: Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!
ELAINE: (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. Would you call her?
JERRY: (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?
ELAINE: (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help you.
JERRY: (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) "Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone." (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out "Just go" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Ross' house]
(Same diner party is going on. News of the cabin has yet to be discussed)
GEORGE: The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?
SUSAN: Uhh.. about the cabin..
MR. ROSS: (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at the time, and dad thought it would be a good idea to get her out into the fresh air. She died there the following winter. And he passed away 10 years later to the day. His last words to me were, (Mrs. Ross, bored out of her mind, has obviously heard this story a million times - she mouths the words as Mr. Ross says them) "Cherish the cabin." Not, uh, "Take care of your sister." (Adding) She's a paraplegic. But, "Cherish the cabin." (Smiling, reflecting) And I have.. for 45 years. It's often been a.. sanctuary for me.
GEORGE: (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.
MR. ROSS: What?
GEORGE: S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it all..
MR. ROSS: When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)
MRS. ROSS: (Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day.
SUSAN: Daddy..
MR. ROSS: Yes?
SUSAN: Daddy, about the cabin..
MRS. ROSS: (Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me! (Laughs again)
MR. ROSS: (To Susan) What about it?
SUSAN: Well, the thing is..
MR. ROSS: What? What is it?
SUSAN: Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?
GEORGE: (Extremely blunt) Burned.
MR. ROSS: Burned?
SUSAN: There was a fire, and it uh..
GEORGE: Burned.
MR. ROSS: (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin burned?
GEORGE: (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..
MRS. ROSS: (Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
MR. ROSS: Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! Did they find anything?
SUSAN: (Solemn) No. Nothing.
MRS. ROSS: (Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha.
(Mr. Ross, devastated, slowly gets up and starts walking toward the room's exit as everyone continues to talk)
GEORGE: Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's really rather ironic - one might even say, in a sense, comical.. (Mr. Ross has, by now, left the room. Mrs. Ross is pointing at George, nodding, laughing. As if to say he hit the bullseye. George calls out to Mr. Ross) Really. Think about it.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Sandra runs out of Jerry's room, hastily putting on her jacket. Jerry follow, buttoning his shirt)
SANDRA: (Offended) I can't believe you said that!
JERRY: What?!
SANDRA: (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like that to me?!
JERRY: What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!
SANDRA: That was a weird thing to say.
JERRY: Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
SANDRA: Ohh, I think you're really sick.
JERRY: (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.
SANDRA: I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)
JERRY: I really think you're making too much of this.
SANDRA: (Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move to the door)
JERRY: Let me walk you to a cab.
SANDRA: (Opens the door) That's ok.
JERRY: I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.
SANDRA: Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)
JERRY: (Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Coffee shop]
(Jerry's telling George about last night)
JERRY: So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.
GEORGE: Wo-hoah! What did you do?
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
JERRY: I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, "That hand should not be on my leg." But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, "Would you mind?!"
GEORGE: Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do they do that?
JERRY: I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..
GEORGE: Alright, so, go ahead.
JERRY: So we go back to my apartment..
GEORGE: (Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
JERRY: So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.
GEORGE: (Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, giddy) What did she say?
JERRY: (Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..
GEORGE: No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?
JERRY: Typical things.
GEORGE: (Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme some typical.
JERRY: She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)
GEORGE: (Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's absolutely filthy.
JERRY: ..And then she starts talking about her panties.
GEORGE: (Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
JERRY: So I said something.
GEORGE: Ok, what did you say?
JERRY: (Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.
GEORGE: Of course.
JERRY: Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"
GEORGE: (Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid out for you"? (Jerry nods) What does that mean?
JERRY: (Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
GEORGE: Well, how did she react?
JERRY: She flipped out! Just left.
GEORGE: Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
JERRY: Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.
GEORGE; Well, what if this girl says something?
JERRY: She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.
JERRY: I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
GEORGE: Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.
JERRY: (Getting up) Alright, big work day.
GEORGE: That's right.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George, with their writing materials, go to sit down in the living room while giving each other pep talks)
GEORGE: Okay.
JERRY: Let's go.
GEORGE: Here we are.
JERRY: Right now.
GEORGE: Let's do it.
JERRY: You and me.
GEORGE: Okay.
JERRY: Alright.
GEORGE: What'dya got?
JERRY: (Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go "Hi", and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Oh, hey.
(Both George and Jerry get up, giving Kramer an excited greeting - talking fast, together) Oh, you guys are working? I'll come back. (Turns to leave. Jerry and George strongly protest with a series of "No, no, no!"'s) No, you guys should get back to work. (More protests)
GEORGE: Don't be silly.
JERRY: Come in, we're taking a break.
KRAMER: (Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?
JERRY: Yeah!
KRAMER: Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some more cigars?
GEORGE: (Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.
KRAMER: (Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see you guys. (Leaves, despite "No, don't go!" and other various comments by Jerry and George)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building]
(Kramer walks up to a secretary)
KRAMER: Buenos dias.
SECRETARY: Buenos dias.
KRAMER: Uh, habla ingles?
SECRETARY: Si.
KRAMER: Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to talk to someone.
SECRETARY: What is this about?
KRAMER: Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely urgent.
SECRETARY: Are you an American?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah.
SECRETARY: I see.. excuse me. (Picks up the phone)
KRAMER: Okay.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry, curled up on his living room chair, and George, laid out on the sofa, are asleep. Jerry's buzzer goes off, waking them up. George rolls off the couch and falls to the floor)
JERRY: (Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
JERRY: C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)
GEORGE: (Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script for a while..
JERRY: (Agreeing) Yeah, we should.
GEORGE: Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?
JERRY: Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?
GEORGE: No, no, no, no.
JERRY: Oh.
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to work.
JERRY: Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.
ELAINE: Why? What happened? Did you talk?
JERRY: Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: Yes.
ELAINE: Really? You really think I should fire her?
JERRY: Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.
(George, sitting out the couch, dozes off to sleep)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: United Nations' Permanent Mission of Cuba building]
(A group of men in suits walk out into the lobby to deal with Kramer)
MAN: (To secretary) Expira te afuera.
KRAMER: (Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.
MAN: What is your name, Senor?
KRAMER: Uh, Kramer.
MAN: So, Senor Kramer, what is this about?
KRAMER: (Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.
MAN: (Confused) Cigars?
KRAMER: (Definite) Cigars.
MAN: What about cigars?
KRAMER: Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket) I saved one of the cigar rings..
MAN: Ohh.. (Laughs, pulling a cigar from his inner coat pocket) You mean - one of these..
KRAMER: (Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah. That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes of those from you, yeah?
MAN: (Deeply sniffs the cigar's aroma) You do realize, of course, these are illegal in your country.
KRAMER: Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?
(The man is staring at Kramer's clothes, mesmerized. He reaches out to touch Kramer's legendary jacket)
MAN: I like that jacket..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Ross' apartment]
(There's a knock at the door. Susan answers it - it's Jerry and George)
SUSAN: Hi!
GEORGE: Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)
SUSAN: Hey, Jerry.
JERRY: Hi.
SUSAN: I thought you two guys were working today.
JERRY: Ah, just - takin' a little break.
GEORGE: (Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands them to her)
SUSAN: Ok, thanks. Come on in for a second. (They move into the living room. Susan gestures to a man sitting on the couch reading the paper) This is my brother, Ricky. He's home from college for the weekend.
GEORGE: Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's your major?
RICKY: (Blunt) I don't have one.
GEORGE: Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks critically back at George)
SUSAN: (Now gestures to an old woman in a wheelchair) And this is my Aunt, Sara.
SARA: (Staring at George) He doesn't look like me.
MRS. ROSS: Sara, what do you have on your wheels?
SARA: Nothing, they're clean.
MRS. ROSS: Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
RICKY: (Annoyed) Yes.
MRS. ROSS: (Concluding) Well, they're filthy. It's just a matter of common courtesy.. (Wheels Sara over to a spot off the rug) When you come in the house you wipe your wheels.
(Doorbell rings)
SUSAN: Excuse me. (Answer the door. It's her doorman, Raymond, carrying a burnt box) Hello, Raymond.
RAYMOND: Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains of the fire.
SUSAN: (Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. (Opens the charred box) Oh, they're letters. (Hands the box to George) Here.
GEORGE: Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)
SUSAN: From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
JERRY AND GEORGE: Oh, wow.
SUSAN: (Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads it) "Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. orgasm (She now has everyone's attention) has left me a cripple. I don't how how I shall ever get back to work.. (Jerry and George make odd faces as Susan is still concentrating on the notes) I love you madly, John. (Pause) P.S. Loved the cabin." (George nods, and Jerry gives a "Oh, of course" reaction)
(A long pause)
GEORGE: Well, we.. we, we, ah..
JERRY: (Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
GEORGE: We really should be, uh, heading out..
JERRY: Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
GEORGE: You know, the time..
(Susan's father is now standing in the hallway)
MR. ROSS: The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme that! (Now holding them against his chest, defensively) Who told you to open this?!
MRS. ROSS: (Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
SARA: (Yelling out) I knew it!
MRS. ROSS: I want to know who John is!
RICKEY: John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!
MR. ROSS: (Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never understand.. (Slowly walks back to his room, leaving everyone speechless. Susan seems to be affected the most. A long pause passes. Jerry gives George a signal that they should go)
GEORGE: Well, we really should be-
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming attractions.
JERRY: Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.
GEORGE: yeah, time is what he's indicating there..
JERRY: (Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
GEORGE: Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.
(Jerry grabs George, leaving)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George, once again, are sitting down in the living room, attempting to write)
GEORGE: Alright, here we go.
JERRY: Alright, let's go.
GEORGE: Come on now.
JERRY: Right now.
GEORGE: Here we go.
JERRY: You and me.
GEORGE: You got it.
JERRY: No foolin'
GEORGE: Ok, so, what'dya got?
JERRY: (Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".
GEORGE: Alright, so, we need something..
JERRY: Yeah.. how about this: I say "How's it goin'?"
GEORGE: "How's it going?" - beautiful.
(They both start to write it down as a pounding on the door sounds) Oh, come on, we were just on a roll now..
JERRY: (Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?
GEORGE: (Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"
JERRY: Did you write it down?
GEORGE: I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"
JERRY: Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
ELAINE: Real good!
JERRY: What?!
ELAINE: Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
JERRY: What?! How?
ELAINE: I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!
JERRY: What calls?!
ELAINE: Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!
JERRY: Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?
ELAINE: (Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean "anything else"?
JERRY: So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?
ELAINE: Yeah!
JERRY: (Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
ELAINE: Why is that beautiful?
JERRY: Oh, no, not beautiful.
ELAINE: It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
JERRY: Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.
ELAINE: No, no.
JERRY: (Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-
ELAINE: (Giving up too easy) Okay.
JERRY: (Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?
(Elaine opens the door to find Kramer and the 3 Cubans dressed up in golf wear, smoking cigars)
KRAMER: Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto.
JERRY: Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.
KRAMER: Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links.
JERRY: Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..
KRAMER: (Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!
(They exit)
ELAINE: (Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are you reading?
GEORGE: Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's really excellent.
ELAINE: (To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.
ELAINE: (Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.
JERRY: (Moving back into the living room) Okay.
ELAINE: (In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in his chair) and they're - all laid out for me. (Leaves, smiling to herself. Jerry and George both look at each other, frozen in their places)
[OPENING MONOLOGUE]
The idea behind the tuxedo is the woman's point of view that men are all the same, so we might as well dress them that way. That's why a wedding is like the joining together of a beautiful glowing bride, and some guy. The tuxedo is a wedding safety device created by women because they know that men are undependable. So in case the groom chickens out, everybody just takes one step over and she marries the next guy. That?s why the wedding vow isn't 'do you take Bill Simpson', its 'do you take this man'.
[INSIDE JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]
JERRY: (answering machine) leave a message and I?ll call you back, thanks. JOE DIVOLA: Jerry, Joe Divola. *Pbt* *Pbt* *Pbt* I have a hair on my tongue, I can't get it off, you know how much I hate that? Course you do, you put it there. I know what you said about me Seinfeld. I know you badmouthed me to the execs at NBC, put the kibosh on my deal. Now I?m gonna put the kibosh on you. You know I?ve kiboshed before, and I will kibosh again.
[JERRY'S APARTMENT.]
(Kramer and Jerry enter)
KRAMER: So, what do you think?
JERRY: About what?
KRAMER: About the opera.
JERRY: Nah, I don't wanna go.
KRAMER: You gotta go.
JERRY: I-I-I don't like the opera. What are they singing for? Who sings? You got something to say, say it!
KRAMER: Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.
JERRY: All right, all right.
KRAMER: That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language
JERRY: So why don't they talk like that now?
KRAMER: Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.
(BUZZER)
KRAMER: Better get that
JERRY: Yeah?
ELAINE: (intercom) it?s me!
JERRY: Come on up.
KRAMER: So, huh?
JERRY: I don't know
KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, its opening night, black tie, Pagliacci! The great clown, the great sad tragic clown, like you.
JERRY: Well it?s very flattering. How did you get these tickets, I heard they're impossible to get.
KRAMER: Oh, well I have many associates.
JERRY: I don't know, opera, it?s not my kind of thing.
KRAMER: All right, you not gonna go I?m not gonna go, I?m gonna call the whole thing off.
JERRY: No, wait a minute, wait a minute, that?s not fair, what about George, Susan and Elaine, what do you need me for?
KRAMER: You're the nucleus, the straw that stirs the drink. You're the Miana!
JERRY: Well I guess if I?m the Miana I should go. All right, all right.
(ELAINE ENTERS)
ELAINE: Hi!
JERRY: Hi!
KRAMER: Hey! Hi Elaine!
ELAINE: You got the tickets right?
KRAMER: Well no, I don't have them on me.
ELAINE: What? That?s why I came all the way over here.
KRAMER: My friends got 'em, I?m going to pick them up tomorrow.
ELAINE: Oh, I was gonna surprise Joey with them, you got an extra one right?
KRAMER: Oh yeah!
JERRY: So I finally get to meet your pal Joey.
ELAINE: Its killing you isn?t it?
JERRY: Yeah, so Joey?s a great lover of the opera
ELAINE: Listen, I got news for ya, its nice to be involved with somebody who?s interested in something other than nick at night. Now he?s got a grip on reality, he's happy, he's well adjusted.

(Opera music playing (Paliachi?) Divola is crying while lifting weights. Photos of Elaine are scattered on the floor.)
[JERRY'S APARTMENT]
JERRY: Well I?m looking forward to meeting him.
ELAINE: I've got to go
JERRY: Where are you going, what?s the rush?
ELAINE: I'm going to surprise Joey, I?ve never been to his apartment so I?m just going to 'pop in'
JERRY: Oh, good, men love that!

JERRY: (shouting) Kramer what am I going to do did you hear that that guy's gonna put a kibosh on me he's crazy he's out of his mind....
KRAMER: Steady, steady, now calm yourself, come on, now get a hold of yourself,
JERRY: What the hell he's supposed to be on medication I don't understand he told me he's getting medication what happened to his medication!?
KRAMER: OK Quiet! Quiet! Now let me think!
JERRY: I'm gonna call the cops. That?s what I?m doing, I?m calling the cops.

JERRY: What do you mean they're not going to do anything, they're the cops, they gotta do something, he just put the kibosh on me, do you know what the kibosh means, its a kibosh!
KRAMER: Yiddigtkk ka kibosh.

KRAMER: Right.... Don't mention my name
JERRY: Oh, I got the machine.
KRAMER: What?s his message like?
JERRY: Nice!
KRAMER: Eh!

KRAMER: Big! Big!
JERRY: and I feel if we can just talk about this we can straighten the whole thing out, so listen, so call me back. Bye.
[JOE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]
(The door is open. Elaine knocks and then enters)
ELAINE: Joey? Joey?
(She sees a wall covered in photos of her. Joe Divola enters and shuts the front door.)
ELAINE: Oh god, oh, its you! You scared me!
JOE DIVOLA: Good. Fear is our most primal emotion.
ELAINE: You left your door open.
JOE DIVOLA: I know, I like to encourage intruders.
ELAINE: (laughs) What?s all this?
JOE DIVOLA: Do you like it? My home is a shrine to you.
ELAINE: Where did you get all these pictures?
JOE DIVOLA: I took them myself with a telephoto lens. Coming out of your office, your apartment, shopping, showering.
ELAINE: Showering?
JOE DIVOLA: I developed them myself in my dark room. Would you like to see?
ELAINE: In the dark room? Uh no, no thank you. Not right now. I'm a day person!... Are you all right?
JOE DIVOLA: Why
ELAINE: Well I don't know, you just don't seem yourself?
JOE DIVOLA: Who am I? Who am I supposed to be?
ELAINE: That?s a good question, good question, its very... exerstential! Who are you? Who am I? Yeah, well.
JOE DIVOLA: What are you doing here?
ELAINE: Oh, nothing, I just stopped by to chat, you know, shoot the breeze.
JOE DIVOLA: Were you able to get those opera tickets to Pagliacci from that friend of yours? I'm really looking forward to it.
ELAINE: Oh, no, he couldn't get them. We're not going.
JOE DIVOLA: Really?
ELAINE: Oh, dammit, you know I just remembered I gotta go, I left something on, the gas, the lights, the water in the tub. Something is on somewhere so I?m just gonna get the uh..
(Divola is blocking the door with his head.)
JOE DIVOLA: You know the story of Pagliacci, Nedda?
ELAINE: Uh.. I?m Elaine!
JOE DIVOLA: He's a clown whose wife is unfaithful to him.
ELAINE: Oh.
JOE DIVOLA: Do you think I?m a clown, Nedda?
ELAINE: Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.
JOE DIVOLA: You've betrayed me with another, haven't you, Nedda? Who is he. I want you to tell me who he is. I want his name. Tell me his name.
ELAINE: Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.
(Divola blocks the door when Elaine tries to leave.)
JOE DIVOLA: Pagliacci kills his wife.
ELAINE: Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown
JOE DIVOLA: You're not leaving
(Elaine sprays Divola in the eyes and he falls on his back. Elaine leaves.)
[JERRY'S APARTMENT.]
JERRY: (on phone) But officer, he threatened me! I don't understand, that?s not right! What if it was the President of the United States I bet you'd investigate. So what?s the difference, I?m a comedian of the United States, and I?ll tell you I?m under just as much pressure. Alright, thanks anyway, ok bye.
(Knock at door.)
JERRY: (cautiously) Who is it?
GEORGE: It's George.
(George enters wearing a very small tuxedo.)
GEORGE: What, are you locking the door now?
JERRY: Well, well, look at you. It?s a little skimpy there isn't it?
GEORGE: Do you know the last time I wore this thing? Six years ago, when I made that toast at Bobby Leighton's wedding.
JERRY: Ooo, that was a bad toast.
GEORGE: It wasn't that bad.
JERRY: I never heard anybody curse in a toast.
GEORGE: I was trying to loosen 'em up a little bit.
JERRY: There were old people there, all the relatives. You were like a Red Fox record. I mean, at the end of the toast nobody even drank. They were just standing there, they were just frozen! That might have been one of the worst all time toasts.
GEORGE: Alright, still her father didn't have to throw me out like that, he could have just asked me to leave. The guy had me in a headlock! Susan's not going tonight you know.
JERRY: What do you mean not going? why not?
GEORGE: I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.
JERRY: Why doesn't she pay for hers?
GEORGE: That's a very good question. You know she and I go out for dinner, she doesn't even reach for the check. That?s all I?m asking for is a reach. Is that so much to ask for?
JERRY: It's nice to get a reach.
(Loud thump is heard from the front door.)
JERRY: Who is it?
KRAMER: It's me!
(Kramer is on the floor)
KRAMER: What, are you locking the door now?
JERRY: Because of Divola! Get in here... How come you're not dressed?
KRAMER: I am dressed.
JERRY: You're going like this?
KRAMER: Yeah. Hey I want you to hear something.
JERRY: I thought you said people dress up when they go to the opera!
KRAMER: People do, I don't.
JERRY: Well what about me! If you're going like that, I?m not going like this.
GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute, do you think I?m comfortable here. I can't change, I?ve got no clothes here! You've got to go like that, I can?t go like this alone!
JERRY: Why should I be uncomfortable just because my apartment is closer to town hall than yours?
GEORGE: That?s not the issue, we're friends, if I?ve got to be uncomfortable, you've got to be uncomfortable too!
JERRY: All right, all right, I?ll wear this. It's bad enough I?ve got to go to the opera I?ve got to sit next to ozzie nelson over here.
Kramer is playing opera music
JERRY: Would you turn that down! What is that crap!
KRAMER: It's Pagliacci!
JERRY: Oh beautiful. Listen, we've got a little problem here, we've got two extra tickets.
KRAMER: Why? What happened?
JERRY: Well Susan isn't going and Elaine just left me a message her friend isn't going either.
KRAMER: That?s fantastic! We'll scalp the tickets, we'll make maybe five hundred a ticket.
GEORGE: What? Really?
KRAMER: Yeah.
GEORGE: People are looking for tickets here?
KRAMER: What, are you kidding? Opening night Pavarotti and Pagliacci. Ha, we're gonna clean up!
GEORGE: Oh man! I knew I was gonna love the opera.
JERRY: Oh yeah right.
KRAMER: OK come on, let?s go get the tickets.
GEORGE: All right, all right.
JERRY: All right, you guys listen, I've got to wait here for Elaine, I'll meet you in front of the theatre.
GEORGE: Oh, wait, isn't scalping illegal?
KRAMER: Oh yeah!
(Kramer and George leave.)
[INSIDE DIVOLA'S APARTMENT]
(Opera music is playing, Joe Divola is putting on white clown make up.)
[OUTSIDE THE THEATRE.]
(Jerry and Elaine are waiting.)
JERRY: You sprayed him in the eyes with Binaca?
ELAINE: Cherry Binaca, it?s new.
JERRY: See, I don't get that. First they come out with the regular, then a year later they come out with the cherry. They know that we like the cherry, start with cherry! Then come out with the regular!
ELAINE: It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.
JERRY: Well you should hear the message from my nut. Where's George and Kramer, I want to get inside already, I don't like standing out here, I feel very vulnerable.
(Jerry drops a coin that he was tossing.)
JERRY: Hey, hey, what are you doing, that?s my quarter.
MAN#1: No it's not, it's mine.
JERRY: I was just flipping it, it's mine.
MAN#1: No, I dropped it, it's mine.
JERRY: All right, do you want the quarter, take the quarter, but don't try and tell me it's yours.
MAN#1: Well it is mine.
JERRY: What, do you think I care about the money? Is that what you think? You want me to show you what I care about money? Here look, here look at this, here's a dollar here look, there, that?s how much I care about money.
(Jerry tears up the dollar.)
MAN#1: You think I care about money, that?s how much I care about money, I don't care about money.
JERRY: Oh yeah, well why don?t you Just get lost.
MAN#1: Why don't you get lost.
JERRY: Because I was standing here, that?s why.
MAN#1: Oh Yeah?
JERRY: Yeah!
(The man walks away.)
JERRY: I kinda like this opera crowd, I feel tough... Anybody else got a problem?
[IN THE PARK]

PARK GUY#1: Hey clown!
PARK GUY#2: hey clown!
PARK GUY#1: Make us laugh, clown!
PARK GUY#2: Nice face, clown!
PARK GUY#2: Make me laugh, clown!

KRAMER: Orchestra, Row G, dead center, primo! You'll think you died and went to heaven.
MAN#2: What do you want for them.
KRAMER: All right, I?ll tell you what I?ll do. Cause you look like a nice guy, a thousand dollars for the duce.
MAN#2: I'll give you five hundred for the pair.
GEORGE: Ok, it's a deal!
KRAMER: Pzzzt. No.
GEORGE: No? Are you crazy?
KRAMER: Look, let me handle this.
GEORGE: Five hundred dollars, that?s a great deal!
KRAMER: You're blowing this, the guys a pigeon.
(The man walks away)
GEORGE: Did you see that? The guy's walking away. What is wrong with you? That was a three hundred dollar profit.
KRAMER: Look, I know what I?m doing here George.
GEORGE: This is not a Metallica concert, it?s an opera alright, a little dignity, a little class, just give me my ticket, I will stand over here and sell it.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah.
GEORGE: Thank you very much. You just stand over there, I?ll stand over here.
KRAMER: I know where I?m standing.
GEORGE: Alright.
KRAMER: Hey!
GEORGE: (shouting) Get your Paliachi!
[OUTSIDE THEATRE]
JERRY: Where are they already?
ELAINE: I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.
JERRY: Hey, look, there's Bobby Eighteen?s father-in-law, Mr Reichman. George and I were just talking about that today, I can?t believe it! That?s the guy who threw George out of the wedding.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!
JERRY: Do you remember the curse toast?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, the curse toast.
JERRY: So, can you believe that message? Now I?ve got to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
ELAINE: Me too
JERRY: Crazy Joe Divola
ELAINE: How do you know his name?
JERRY: What do you mean? Why wouldn't I know his name?
ELAINE: I never told you his name.
JERRY: I never told you his name.
ELAINE: Wait a second, who are we talking about here?
JERRY: Joe Divola.
ELAINE: Right, Joe Divola
JERRY: How do you know his name?
ELAINE: I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.
(They click)
JERRY: Oh my god, its Joe Divola
ELAINE: Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?
JERRY: That madman is trying to kill me.
ELAINE: Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!
JERRY: Oh! He said that! Can you imagine what he'll do if he sees me with you! He'll think I?m the one who ruined his deal at NBC and took away his girl, he'll put a kibosh on me!
ELAINE: Oooohh, what about me!
(Divola walks up to them, dressed in the clown suit.)
JOE DIVOLA: Excuse me
ELAINE & JERRY: Aaahhhhh!!
[ALLEYWAY]
(George still hasn't sold the ticket.)
GEORGE: But this is Pavarotti!
MAN#3: Three hundred dollars, that?s a lot of money.
Mr & Mrs Reichman are walking through the alley
MR REICHMAN: You know Steven Holstman (?) did a production at Tunis last yeas and from what I understand, the Moslems really took to it.
GEORGE: All right, I?ll tell you what, you seem like a nice guy, let?s stop jerking around. Give me.. two hundred and fifty dollars, I?ve got people waiting for me, I've got to get the hell out of here.
MR REICHMAN: Scalping! I told them to put out extra security.. Excuse me.
GEORGE: Hey pop, would you buzz off, I've got something cooking.
MR REICHMAN: Costanza!?
GEORGE: Mr Reichman?
MR REICHMAN: You've still got a mouth like a surd give me those tickets.
MRS REICHMAN: Harold, no, Harold, Harold be careful of you're hair transplant!
[OUTSIDE THE THEATRE]
JOE DIVOLA: Anything is welcome, I accept change.
JERRY: I don't have anything, I gave it to that guy.
JOE DIVOLA: You know, you could just say no, you don't have to humiliate me. I may be dressed as a clown but I am a person.
JERRY: I'm telling you, the guy took.....
JOE DIVOLA: And I don't need people like you looking down their noses at me. I am just a street performer out here trying to make enough to get by.
(Mrs Reichman runs past)
MRS REICHMAN: Doctor! Doctor! Is there a doctor anywhere!
JOE DIVOLA: What, are you showing off to your girlfriend here, is that it?
ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. We dated for a while, but things didn't really work out.
JOE DIVOLA: You people make me sick.
JERRY: That is one angry clown!
[Middle Monologue]
JERRY: The hardest part about being a clown, it seems to me, would be that you're constantly referred to as a clown. "Who was that clown?", "I'm not working with that clown, did you hire that clown?", "The guy's a clown!". How do you even start into being a clown, how do you know that you want to be a clown, I guess you get to a point where you're pants look so bad, it's actually easier to become a clown than having the proper alterations done. Because if you think about it, a clown, if there isn't a circus around them, is really just a very annoying person. You're in the back seat of this guys Volkswagen, "What, you're picking somebody else up? Oh man!"
[Outside The Theatre]
JERRY: (Singing) Camera, curtains, lights - This is it, we'll hit the heights - Oh what heights we'll hit - On with the show this is it!
ELAINE: You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.
JERRY: Oh there's that clown again, what does he want from me. Look I?m serious, I?m not kidding, I don't have the quarter, that guy took it.
JOE DIVOLA: I don't want any money.
ELAINE: I smell cherry.
JOE DIVOLA: It's Binaca.
JERRY: Binaca?
(They see the real clown singing and realize that they are talking to Crazy Joe. They run away.)
[ALLEYWAY]
(George is finalizing the deal.)
GEORGE: What did we say? Two seventy-five?
MAN#3: Two fifty.
GEORGE: Two fifty? Are you sure
MAN#3: Yeah, yeah, I?m sure.
GEORGE: All right, all right, two fifty.
SUSAN: George!
GEORGE: S-Susan
SUSAN: I can't believe it, I?m so glad I caught you.
GEORGE: What are you doing here, I though you were going to the airport.
SUSAN: Oh, there was some problem with the plane, they landed in Philadelphia.
GEORGE: So what, they don?t have another plane? She couldn't take a bus?
SUSAN: She's coming in tomorrow. I made it!
GEORGE: Yeah you made it, how about that.
SUSAN: Oh, I?m so excited, now we get to see the opera together.
(George gives the man the ticket and takes the money.)
GEORGE: We get to go to the opera together!
SUSAN: Who's that?
GEORGE: That?s-that?s-Harry Fong, he's a very good friend of mine and he's a big opera buff. Enjoy the show there harry!... You know what.
[ENTRANCE TO THEATER.]
JERRY: Come on, you gotta let us in
USHER: Not without tickets.
JERRY: We have tickets, we just don't have 'em with us.
USHER: Well that?s a problem. Excuse me.
JERRY: You don't understand, someone's after us, a crazy clown is trying to kill us.
USHER: A crazy clown is after you? Oh that?s rich. Now clear the entrance so people with tickets can get through.
(Kramer slides in.)
JERRY&ELAINE: We're with him, we're with him.
KRAMER: Are you guys ready?
JERRY&ELAINE: Yeah, Yeah!!
KRAMER: Have you seen George?
JERRY: We thought he was with you.
ELAINE: Come on, he's on his own, come on!
[SITTING IN THE THEATER]
KRAMER: These are great seats huh?
ELAINE: Yeah
KRAMER: Yeah
JERRY: Boy, some cast, huh? Pavarotti, Aver Martone.
ELAINE: Aver Martone. I've heard of her, who's she playing?
JERRY: She's playing, Pagliacci?s wife, Nedda.
ELAINE: Nedda?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Oh my god..
(Man #3 enters and shuffles to his seat.)
MAN#3: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
(Susan comes in from the other side.)
JERRY: Susan! What are you doing here?
SUSAN: My Friend's flight couldn?t make it.
JERRY: Where's George?
MAN#3: I got his ticket.
SUSAN: He decided not to come. He said he was uncomfortable.
JERRY: Uncomfortable? How does you think I feel?.. Hey let me ask you something, how much did you pay for that ticket?
MAN#3: One seventy-five.
JERRY: Kramer, who'd you sell your ticket to?
KRAMER: Some nut in a clown suit!
(The show starts, everyone claps except Elaine and Jerry who look very frightened.)
[Closing Monologue]
JERRY: I had some friends drag me to an opera recently, you know how they've got those little opera glasses, you know, do you really need binoculars, I mean how big do these people have to get before you can spot 'em. These opera kids they're going two-fifty, two-eighty, three-twenty-five, they're wearing big white woolly vests, the women have like the breastplates, the bullet hats with the horn coming out. If you can't pick these people out, forget opera, think about optometry, maybe that?s more you're thing.
[Jerry and George talking near a bar.]
JERRY: We're dead.
GEORGE: We're not dead.
JERRY: We are dead.
GEORGE: Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
JERRY: All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.
GEORGE: So we'll do it tomorrow.
JERRY: Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?
GEORGE: About six years ago.
JERRY: I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
GEORGE: Women like skiers.
JERRY: So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
GEORGE: Yeah. Right.
JERRY: Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.
GEORGE: The closet business? What's the closet business?
JERRY: What is it your business?
GEORGE: I'm interested.
JERRY: She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.
GEORGE: So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah. So what happened?
JERRY: So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.
MARLA: (Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
JERRY: George, Marla.
GEORGE: Marla.
MARLA: George. Jerry, Stacey.
JERRY: Stacey.
STACEY: Jerry.
JERRY: George, Stacey.
GEORGE: Stacey.
STACEY: George.
JERRY: George.
GEORGE: Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey)
MARLA: So, how was your trip to Berlin?
JERRY: Trip to Berlin?
MARLA: Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You said you were going to Berlin for a while.
JERRY: Oh, right, right.
MARLA: The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted to be part of the celebration.
JERRY: Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains out?"
MARLA: You, know my boyfriend went.
JERRY: Really?
MARLA: Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited and decided to go.
JERRY: Oh, did he like it?
MARLA: I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side of the bar)
GEORGE: Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.
STACEY: Wow, what a great job. A writer.
GEORGE: Not a bad way to make a buck.
STACEY: Sounds great.
GEORGE: Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)
[Jerry and George at Monk's]
JERRY: So, are you gonna go out with her?
GEORGE: I might.
JERRY: What about Susan?
GEORGE: What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?
JERRY: Depends.
GEORGE: Depends on what?
JERRY: On many factors.
GEORGE: Like what?
JERRY: Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?
GEORGE: No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
JERRY: What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?
GEORGE: Implied.
JERRY: She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
GEORGE: There might be some moisturizer.
JERRY: Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?
GEORGE: (Pause) Yeah.
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: You got yourself a girlfriend.
GEORGE: Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?
JERRY: I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...
GEORGE: Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.
JERRY: You're going to make a good father someday.
GEORGE: Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.
JERRY: Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
GEORGE: No, what?
JERRY: The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.
GEORGE: Why? What do you mean?
JERRY: Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?
GEORGE: Oh, right. Oh no, man.
JERRY: you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.
JERRY: (sarcastically) Oh, yeah.
GEORGE: Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.
JERRY: This is your plan?
GEORGE: No, no. I'm just thinking.
JERRY: I don't think you are.
[Jerry with Marla, who is measuring his closet space.]
MARLA: Let me tell you what I think.
JERRY: Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.
MARLA: Are you very fussy about your pants?
JERRY: I don't think I am.
MARLA: Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
JERRY: Try me.
MARLA: Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. We'll put everything on hooks.
JERRY: Everything?
MARLA: Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We could get eighty hooks on here.
JERRY: You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: What are you doing?
KRAMER: I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: This is not a good time.
KRAMER: Five minutes. What?
JERRY: What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
KRAMER: Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.
JERRY: Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)
KRAMER: Well, wow.
JERRY: Marla, Kramer.
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
KRAMER: Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.
JERRY: There's weather.
KRAMER: Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for me.
JERRY: I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
KRAMER: No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch the Knick game tonight?
JERRY: I don't know.
KRAMER: Will you tape it?
JERRY: Kramer... (points to Marla)
KRAMER: Yeah. (He exits)
JERRY: So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
MARLA: Never came back.
JERRY: Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.
MARLA: It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
JERRY: Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
ELAINE: It's me.
JERRY: Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?
ELAINE: I didn't get it.
JERRY: Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
MARLA: Well, he wanted me to move in with him.
JERRY: Snapple?
MARLA: No thanks.
JERRY: Go on.
MARLA: Well I wouldn't move in because...
JERRY: Yes.
MARLA: Well because...
JERRY: Yeah.
MARLA: Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hello!
JERRY: Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted to return your tape.
JERRY: Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.
MARLA: I should be going.
ELAINE: No, no, I'm leaving.
JERRY: I like that thing in your hair there.
ELAINE: Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?
MARLA: No thanks.
ELAINE: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) Ahh.
MARLA: I should be going.
JERRY: So we'll talk about the hooks then?
MARLA: Yes. (She exits)
ELAINE: What? Was it something I said?
JERRY: She's a virgin, she just told me.
ELAINE: Well I didn't know.
JERRY: Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
ELAINE: Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?
JERRY: No, no, I mean...
ELAINE: 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
JERRY: Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?
GEORGE: It's George.
[Cut to George looking out Jerry's apartment at Marla.]
GEORGE: She's a virgin?
JERRY: A virgin.
GEORGE: Wow. So what're you gonna do?
JERRY: I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.
GEORGE: I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.
JERRY: You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.
GEORGE: You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.
JERRY: Yeah, me too.
GEORGE: We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?
JERRY: All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.
KRAMER: I'm in. Let's go for it.
GEORGE: What do you want?
KRAMER: I don't care, whatever.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.
KRAMER: Okay. What are you getting?
GEORGE: I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
KRAMER: What's a Chow Fung?
GEORGE: It's a broad noodle.
KRAMER: What do you mean, a broad noodle?
GEORGE: It's a big flat noodle.
KRAMER: Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
GEORGE: What kind of noodle do you want?
KRAMER: Who says I want a noodle?
GEORGE: All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.
KRAMER: All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of my pea pods.
GEORGE: Fine.
KRAMER: Get extra MSG.
[Elaine and Marla at Monk's Cafe.]
ELAINE: Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want to flee the scene before the police get there.
MARLA: So they just leave?
ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn into farmers suddenly.
MARLA: Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
ELAINE: Eh.
[Jerry's place, George and Jerry are sitting.]
JERRY: All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.
GEORGE: Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
JERRY: Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.
GEORGE: Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.
JERRY: Your butler?
GEORGE: Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.
JERRY: What about me?
GEORGE: Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)
JERRY: (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?
ELAINE: There was a bit of an accident.
PING: Head hurts. Head really hurts.
JERRY: What happened?
ELAINE: Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his head and everything went flying.
GEORGE: Something happened to the food?
PING: I only saved one bag.
JERRY: Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
MARLA: I'll get some ice.
GEORGE: (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, you got the food?
JERRY: Yeah, here.
KRAMER: What took you so long? Hey, Ping!
PING: Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)
KRAMER: Yeah. Where's yours?
GEORGE: He dropped it.
KRAMER: Oh, that's too bad.
ELAINE: You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to go that fast.
PING: No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.
KRAMER: (To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?
ELAINE: (To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
JERRY: (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
PING: (To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.
KRAMER: (To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.
PING: (To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.
GEORGE: (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
KRAMER: (To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.
[George and Jerry in the NBC lobby.]
JERRY: A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!
GEORGE: All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.
JERRY: What do you mean? They know we're here.
GEORGE: I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.
JERRY: No, no, would you get up?
GEORGE: I can do this, Jerry.
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits)
(Woman enters.)
WOMAN: Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)
JERRY: Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)
MAN #1: Hey, Jerry.
JERRY: Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.
RITA: Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.
JERRY: Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?
RITA: He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of Blossom.
JERRY: Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)
RITA: Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.
MAN #2: Where's George?
JERRY: Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.
SUSAN: David Letterman's on the floor?
JERRY: Yeah, he just walked by.
RITA: Well, I think we should get started anyway.
JERRY: Yeah, good idea.
RITA: So how are you guys comin' along?
JERRY: Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.
RITA: Good. (Pause)
JERRY: Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?
RITA: So that's the idea?
JERRY: Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.
MAN #2: Those collars are funny!
MAN #1: Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing immediately. (George enters)
GEORGE: You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?
RITA: I'm Rita Kearson.
GEORGE: Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.
JERRY: Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.
[Jerry and George enter Jerry's place to see Kramer watching (and playing) Jeopardy.]
JERRY: So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?
GEORGE: No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.
KRAMER: You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.
JERRY: Would you give him the TV back?
KRAMER: Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.
GEORGE: I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan)
KRAMER: (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
SUSAN: Hello?
GEORGE: Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?
SUSAN: What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. I'm fired!
GEORGE: Fired? Why?
SUSAN: Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.
KRAMER: (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
GEORGE: But I had no... I didn't realize.
SUSAN: You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! You're a stupid, stupid man!
GEORGE: I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
KRAMER: (To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.
SUSAN: I'll speak to you later.
GEORGE: (Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!
JERRY: Why did he fire her?
GEORGE: Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!
KRAMER: What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!
JERRY: You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
GEORGE: Another job?
JERRY: Couple of interviews.
GEORGE: Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.
[Jerry and Marla are making out in his closet.]
MARLA: Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have sex.
JERRY: What? Leave? Where? Why?
MARLA: You know, the apartment.
JERRY: Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
MARLA: Well what if it was my apartment?
JERRY: Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
MARLA: Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
JERRY: Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.
MARLA: Maybe I should get going.
[Jerry and Elaine at a bar.]
JERRY: What else did you say to her?
ELAINE: Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
JERRY: More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.
ELAINE: Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe me.
JERRY: What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?
ELAINE: You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. You better be nice to her.
JERRY: I was trying to be.
ELAINE: Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He lucked out, huh?
JERRY: Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.
ELAINE: Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had a real good thing going.
[Cut over to George and a woman]
GEORGE: What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.
WOMAN: A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's writing a sitcom.
CAROL: A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)
WOMAN: A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use it to hit on me!
[Setting: Monk's Coffee shop]
(Jerry and Kramer are sitting opposite Elaine at a booth, eating lunch)
JERRY: (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
ELAINE: Mm-hm.
JERRY: You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-
ELAINE: (Smiling, chewing) Who, me?
JERRY: You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
ELAINE: (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
KRAMER: (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
(Jerry and Elaine both laugh at Kramer's impression as George slowly enters. He's in a melancholy state)
KRAMER: Hey, Georgie.
JERRY AND ELAINE: Hi.
(George sits down next to Elaine - opposite Kramer)
JERRY: (To George) What's the matter?
GEORGE: (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
JERRY: "Caught" you? Doing what?
GEORGE: You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
ELAINE: (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
GEORGE: (Nods) Uh-huh.
KRAMER: (Laughing) She caught you?
(Elaine laughs with Kramer)
JERRY: Where?
GEORGE: (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. (Jerry and Elaine look at each other - enjoying the story) My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it..
JERRY: "Glamour"?
(Kramer and Elaine laugh slightly)
GEORGE: ..So, one thing lead to another..
JERRY: So, what did she do?
GEORGE: First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
KRMAER: (Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
GEORGE: I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
JERRY: What did you do?
GEORGE: I zipped up!
ELAINE: (Wide-eyed) So, she fell?
GEORGE: Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
ELAINE: No, I guess you couldn't have..
JERRY: (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't think so.
ELAINE: (Finishing it off) ..done that.
GEORGE: So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
ELAINE: (Between chuckles) How is she?
GEORGE: (Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
ELAINE: (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.
GEORGE: It's not funny, Elaine.
ELAINE: (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
GEORGE: Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!".. I said, "Because it's there!"
(Kramer laughs, sipping his drink)
JERRY: "Glamour"?
(Elaine laughs)
GEORGE: (Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.
ELAINE: What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
GEORGE: (Definite) All together.
(The next three lines are said at the exact same time)
ELAINE: Oh, gimme a break..
JERRY: (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
KRAMER: Oh, like you're gonna stop?
JERRY AND ELAINE: C'mon..
GEORGE: You don't think I can?
JERRY: No chance.
GEORGE: (Daring) You think you could?
JERRY: Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
GEORGE: Care to make it interesting?
JERRY: Sure, how much?
GEORGE: A hundred dollars.
JERRY: (Pointing) You're on.
KRAMER: (Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (Clicks his tongue)
JERRY: You?
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: You'll be out before we get the check.
ELAINE: (Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.
GEORGE AND JERRY: (Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no..
ELAINE: Why?
JERRY: (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
ELAINE: What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) Why?
JERRY: Because you're a woman!
ELAINE: So what?
JERRY: It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
ELAINE: (Sarcastic) Oh.
JERRY: We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
ELAINE: Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
KRAMER: (Making a point) Not everyday.
GEORGE: Alright, look, you want to be in?
ELAINE: Yeah!
GEORGE: You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
KRAMER: No, a thousand!
ELAINE: No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
GEORGE: Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
JERRY: (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.
GEORGE: Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
JERRY: Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system.
KRAMER: Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
(Jerry, Elaine, and George all hook their pinkies onto his, in a 'pinkie promise', they all pull their hand away, yelling out "Yeah!")
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's sitting on the couch, eating cereal while George is on the phone with his mother)
GEORGE: (Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. (Hangs up, slamming it down on the coffee table. He sits down next to Jerry) My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? (Scoffs, shaking his head) You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist.. (Laughing, he snorts)
JERRY: (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
GEORGE: (Defensively) Whatever.
(Intercom buzzes, Jerry gets up to answer it)
JERRY: How is she?
GEORGE: (Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
JERRY: (Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
ELAINE: It's me.
JERRY: Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing tonight?
JERRY: (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
GEORGE: Oh, the virgin?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
JERRY: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.
(Kramer enters, heading for Jerry's window)
KRAMER: Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.
(George and Jerry quickly join him at the window)
JERRY: Where?
KRAMER: Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on the left?
GEORGE: (In awe) Wow!
JERRY: (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
(All eyes are glued to the woman)
GEORGE: (Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
KRAMER: ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts the door behind him)
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
GEORGE: I would imagine it's all naked.
JERRY: What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
GEORGE: (Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One big nude-a-rama.
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY AND GEORGE: (Only turning back for a second) Hey.
ELAINE: Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?
JERRY: (Over his shoulder) Not me.
GEORGE: (Also, over his shoulder) Not me.
ELAINE: What're you looking at?
JERRY: There's a naked woman across the street.
ELAINE: (Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
JERRY: (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
ELAINE: (Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
JERRY: (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
GEORGE: Have a good time.
(Kramer casually enters, takes a few step toward the kitchen, and slaps a wad of bills onto the counter)
KRAMER: (Declaring) I'm out!
(Kramer now has the attention of everyone in the room. Jerry's mouth is open in shock. A moment passes)
ELAINE: What?!
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.
GEORGE: You're out?!
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?
ELAINE: Well, that was fast!
JERRY: Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks out, shutting the door behind him)
(Jerry, Elaine, and George all look at each other, reflecting)
ELAINE: ..And then there were three.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Hospital room]
(Estelle is on a hospital bed. George, sitting back in a chair, is visiting her)
ESTELLE: I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a quart of milk, I come home, and find my son treating his body like it was an amusement park!
GEORGE: (Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.
ESTELLE: Don't give me "Ma". It's a good thing I didn't hit the table. I could of cracked my head open.
GEORGE: Ma, people can hear you.
ESTELLE: (Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square Garden. Thousands of people could watch you! You could be a big star!
GEORGE: (Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!
ESTELLE: I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
GEORGE: No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
ESTELLE: Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
GEORGE: (Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
ESTELLE: I want you to go see somebody.
GEORGE: Well, I am not going.
ESTELLE: It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
(George's cousin, Shelly, enters)
SHELLY: Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?
GEORGE: (Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive the experience now?!
(On the other side of a curtain divider, the silhouette of a shapely nurse can be seen entering)
NURSE: Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath.
(The shadow of a patient awakening can be seen)
DENISE: Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
(The two women go about preparing the sponge bath. George is visibly affected - breathing heavily, and staring at them through the curtain)
SHELLY: (Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, writing - thing?
GEORGE: (Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the conversation) Yeah.. television.
(The patient, Denise, is trying to get her gown off)
NURSE: Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your head..
DENISE: Oh.. thank you.
SHELLY: (Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely mesmerized) What is it you're doing, exactly?
(A moment passes. George seems not to have heard his cousin)
ESTELLE: George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: New York Health Club]
(Elaine, dressed for a work-out, is signing forms while talking with her friend, Joyce)
JOYCE: So, when was the last time you took a class?
ELAINE: Oh, it's been a while.
JOYCE: (Overly excited) Are you psyched?
ELAINE: (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.
JOYCE: Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
ELAINE: Why is that?
JOYCE: (Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
(Elaine looks over, and her jaw drops to the floor. Breathless, she turns back to her friend)
ELAINE: (Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy Junior's here!
JOYCE: He's gonna be in your class today.
ELAINE: (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
JOYCE: I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
ELAINE: Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's car]
(Stationary, Jerry's girlfriend, Marla, and him are making out. After some deep kissing, Marla breaks away)
MARLA: Let's slow it down a little.
JERRY: "Slow it down"?
MARLA: Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know..
JERRY: Ah, yeah.. I know.
MARLA: You're okay with that, right?
JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. (Faint) I don't care about that.
MARLA: So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
JERRY: (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.
MARLA: Alright, then. Good night.
JERRY: Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's bedroom]
(Jerry, in the middle of the night, is moving around - unable to get to sleep, he's restless. Scene cuts to George. He's wide awake, and staring at the ceiling. Cut to
Elaine. She's settling into bed, unable to get to sleep. The scene takes a final cut to Kramer. He's sound asleep)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's in a grouchy mood. Kramer enters)
KRAMER: (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
JERRY: (Out of it) Yeah, good morning.
KRAMER: Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns toward Jerry's window)
JERRY: She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
KRAMER: (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
JERRY: (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
KRAMER: So, you're still master of your domain.
JERRY: (Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to the nudist) her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
KRAMER: Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?
JERRY: I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
KRAMER: Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.
JERRY: (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
KRAMER: (Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think: "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!
JERRY: Look, I'm sorry-
KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
JERRY: Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!
KRAMER: (Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin' ya! Please! (Claps hands) Come on! Please!
(A pause as Jerry thinks it over)
JERRY: Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
KRAMER: Yes!
JERRY: ..Alright.
KRAMER: (Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)
JERRY: She's not there!
KRAMER: Oh, I can wait..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Monk's Coffee shop]
(Jerry and George are sitting opposite each other in a booth)
JERRY: So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
GEORGE: Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going nuts.
JERRY: Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
GEORGE: (Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..
(Jerry nods)
JERRY: (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
GEORGE: (Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
JERRY: Lord of the manor.
(Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry)
ELAINE: John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
JERRY: Really? Did you talk to him?
ELAINE: No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (Thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
GEORGE: "Quite a workout"? What did you say?
ELAINE: (Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."
JERRY: (Adding, fake praise) Good one.
ELAINE: So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) So we're walkin' and talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: "Do you wanna split a cab uptown?" And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin', right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin' about! (Deep breath) So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, (Laughs) and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house.. (Picks up a glass of cold water and presses it up to her forehead to cool her off) Oh, God..
JERRY: But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
ELAINE: (Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a piece of food into her mouth)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Estelle's hospital room]
(George quickly runs in, turning around - he checks both his watch and the wall clock. He smiles to himself)
ESTELLE: You're back.
GEORGE: Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.
ESTELLE: I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this.
GEORGE: You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
ESTELLE: You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the deli and get me a sandwich..
GEORGE: (Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the divider in anticipation)
ESTELLE: (Let down) Could you go now, George? I'm very hungry. I'm weak.
GEORGE: Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?
ESTELLE: I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
GEORGE: (Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a little time with you.
ESTELLE: But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting hours are almost over!
GEORGE: Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.
ESTELLE: Get the hell outta here. (Angrily sets them aside) I'm sorry you came.
(Nurse enters)
NURSE: (To patient) Six-thirty. Time for your sponge bath.
(George eagerly takes his seat, looking up at their shadows on the divider)
ESTELLE: George.. I'm huuunnnggry!
GEORGE: (Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: New York Health Club]
(Elaine, dressed to impress, walks up to the counter. She's obviously looking around for JFK Jr.)
JOYCE: Hi!
ELAINE: Hi.
JOYCE: Did you get your hair done today?
ELAINE: No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking around, she quickly checks her breath)
JOYCE: You know who - isn't here. He was in the early class today. (Elaine looses her composure) But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
ELAINE: (Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
JOYCE: Let me just put this back. (Turns to put a stack of shorts away)
(Elaine violently grabs her jacket, pulling Joyce back in her direction)
ELAINE: No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
JOYCE: (Uneasy) He asked about you.
ELAINE: (Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
JOYCE: He wanted to know your situation.
ELAINE: (Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
JOYCE: I-I told him you were single.
ELAINE: That was good. That was very good.
JOYCE: He said you were just his type.
ELAINE: (Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
JOYCE: He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock - so he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.
(Breathless, Elaine almost collapses)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Kramer's at the window while Jerry's on the phone with his mother, watching TV)
JERRY: Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality. Okay, alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. (Hangs up)
KRAMER: (Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there.. (Jerry looks back at Kramer in envy) It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed.. that's good, that's good.. yes, yes, yes..
JERRY: (Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus..
(Kramer joins in with Jerry, only, he has a different version)
KRAMER: The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on..
(Both Kramer and Jerry continue to sing the two different versions, trying to over ride the other)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: George's room]
(George is wide awake, staring at the ceiling. Scene cuts to Jerry. Once again, he's restless and flings the covers off him. Scene cuts to Kramer - he's out like a light. The scene takes a final cut to Elaine. Foreshadowing the next scene, she's sound asleep too)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and George. They're bickering at each other due to the lack of sex)
GEORGE: All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
JERRY: I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!
ELAINE: (Through intercom) It's Elaine.
JERRY: (Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)
GEORGE: Where did you get those socks?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: I think those are my socks!
JERRY: How are these your socks?!
GEORGE: I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
GEORGE: Yeah, well, they're my socks!
JERRY: They're my socks!
(A brief moment passes as they look at each other)
GEORGE: Oh boy..
JERRY: What are we doing here..
GEORGE: ..Oh boy.
JERRY: This is ridiculous.
GEORGE: Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
JERRY: I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
GEORGE: Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
(Elaine slowly enters, shutting the door behind her)
ELAINE: Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts to count it up)
GEORGE: (Shocked) You caved?!
JERRY: It's over?
GEORGE: You're out?
JERRY: Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
(Elaine sets the bills down on the counter)
GEORGE: I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
JERRY: What happened?
ELAINE: It was..uh.. John-John.
JERRY AND GEORGE: Ohhhhh.. John-John.
JERRY: But you made it through the day before.
ELAINE: Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
JERRY: Why outside here?
ELAINE: Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
(George picks up the money, counting it)
JERRY: Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
GEORGE: And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.
ELAINE: (Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry and Marla are making out on the couch)
MARLA: Let's go in the bedroom.
JERRY: Really?
MARLA: Yes.
JERRY: You sure?
MARLA: Yes.
JERRY: You really want to?
MARLA: I do. I'm ready.
JERRY: Okay..
MARLA: I know how difficult this must have been for you.
JERRY: (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
(They both laugh slightly)
MARLA: What do you mean?
JERRY: Well, it's kinda silly, but..
(Scene cuts to Elaine on the sidewalk waiting for JFK Jr. She checks her watch. Scene cuts back to Jerry's apartment. Marla, obviously upset, is putting her coat on)
MARLA: Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
JERRY: No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
MARLA: I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
(She leaves, slamming the door. Jerry hangs his head, then directs his attention to his window. Eagerly walking over, he sits in his chair, staring at the woman)
[Scene cuts to Elaine. Marla walks out in front of her, trying to hail a taxi]
ELAINE: Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
MARLA: I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! You're horrible.
Horrible! All of you!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
ELAINE: What happened?
JERRY: I told her about the contest.
ELAINE: Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
(George enters)
GEORGE: (To Elaine) Hey, what happened?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
ELAINE: (Let down) He didn't show.
GEORGE: Yeah, he did.
ELAINE: What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
GEORGE: No, no, no. He just left.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
JERRY: Marla?
GEORGE: Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
ELAINE: (Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?
GEORGE: Yeah.
ELAINE: They drove away?
GEORGE: Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
JERRY: (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!
(All three crowd around the window)
ELAINE: (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
GEORGE: Kramer?!
(A brief pause)
ELAINE: He's waving..
(All three wave back)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine's bedroom]
(Elaine's sound asleep. Scene cuts to George, then Jerry. They too, are sleeping. Scene takes a cut to Kramer and the nudist - both asleep; then a final cut to Marla's bedroom. She's sleeping with JFK Jr)
MARLA: Ohh, John. That was wonderful..
(Scene ends)
[Opening Monologue]
...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer; there's always a small problem ``There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little* late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little* closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!''.
[Open with Jerry and Elaine in a car on their way to the airport. Elaine is singing a poppy Jazz tune.]
ELAINE: Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...
JERRY: Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could you shut-up?
(They both chortle, and Jerry is hot so he's taking his coat off, but Elaine refuses to take the wheel and Jerry's hand gets stuck and before you can say "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", they collide head-on with a Snapple truck....)
ELAINE: Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.
JERRY: I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?
ELAINE: Gimme ten bucks and find out...
JERRY: So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...
ELAINE: Yeah, worked out good.
JERRY: And here's the beauty--
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: George is pickin' us up at the airport.
ELAINE: Get out of here! Why?
JERRY: You know that awning outside my building?
ELAINE: Yeah...
JERRY: He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.
ELAINE: So what happened?
JERRY: He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.
ELAINE: Hey, how we doin' on time?
JERRY: Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...
ELAINE: Hey! Wait up!
JERRY: Hey! Wait up!
DRIVER: Sorry. Heh heh heh...
(The driver speeds away without our heroes, and he seems pretty happy about it. )
(Finally inside, they check their luggage... )
SKYCAP: Where you goin'?
JERRY: Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills for a tip. You got anything?
ELAINE: Yeah, you want five?
JERRY: Gimme ten.
ELAINE: You're giving him *ten* dollars?
JERRY: Well, we got three bags.
ELAINE: That's a pretty big tip...
JERRY: That's what they get!
ELAINE: They don't get that much.
JERRY: Let's ask him.
ELAINE: We can't ask him...
JERRY: Let's see what he says.
ELAINE: Jerry, we don't have time for this...
JERRY: Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you usually get for a tip.
SKYCAP: Depends on the person, depends on the bag.
JERRY: Uh, how about a couple of people like us.
SKYCAP: People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you don't even look like you know what you're doing...
JERRY: C'mon, seriously...
SKYCAP: Well, since you asked, usually, I get five dollars a bag.
ELAINE: What!?
SKYCAP: That's right.
ELAINE: *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.
SKYCAP: Look, you asked, I told you.
ELAINE: You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...
JERRY: All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...
ELAINE: You're lucky I don't report you...
SKYCAP: JFK...
SKYCAP: ...Honolulu.
ELAINE: Wait up!
JERRY: You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!
JERRY & ELAINE: The flight's been canceled?!?!
TICKET LADY: Everything into JFK's booked... No, wait-- I have two seats into Laguardia-- but they're not together. It's boarding right now.
JERRY: We'll take 'em!
ELAINE: We're not going to sit together?
JERRY: Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll read.
ELAINE: Well, what about George? He's supposed to pick us up at Kennedy.
JERRY: We'll call him...
ELAINE: There's no time.
JERRY: No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
TICKET LADY: There's no time.
JERRY: There's no time. All right, we'll call him from the plane.
TICKET LADY: I have one seat in first class, and one in coach. The price is the same since your flight was canceled.
(The two have that uncomfortable politeness that only comes about when you're down to the last piece of pizza. Jerry breaks the silence:)
JERRY: I'll take the first class.
ELAINE: Jerry!
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: Why should you get the first class?
JERRY: Elaine, have you ever flown first class?
ELAINE: No.
JERRY: All right then. See? You won't know what you're missing. I've flown first class, Elaine-- I can't go back to coach. I can't... I won't...
ELAINE: You flew here coach.
JERRY: Yeah, that's a point...
ELAINE: All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.
JERRY: Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.
(They board the plane, and the flight attendant "welcomes" Elaine aboard.)
ATTENDANT #1: Third row right...
(Then Mr. First class Jerry comes aboard.)
ATTENDANT #1: Oh, you're in here, sir. Welcome aboard.
JERRY: Bon voyage, Lainey!
(Elaine is robbed of her peek into the first class section by a drawn curtain and she goes to her seat. However, someone comes after her and:)
PASSENGER #1: Oh, excuse me... Um, excuse me, miss, I think you're sitting in my seat...
(Elaine moves over, and he moves in. The guy's got like 5 bags and Laptop.)
PASSENGER #1: I never check my bags-- I can't stand that wait in the baggage area.
ELAINE: Great... [To herself] Help me...
(Jerry gets to his seat, however, he also is in the wrong seat:)
TIA: Excuse me, I think you're in my seat...
JERRY: Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!
[George and Kramer in the car.]
GEORGE: Hey, thanks for coming with me.
KRAMER: Hey, what made you think you could touch that awning?
GEORGE: I confused it with another awning.
KRAMER: So how we doin' on time?
GEORGE: We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!
KRAMER: Will you relax?!
GEORGE: Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!
KRAMER: This is the best way to go!
GEORGE: Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...
KRAMER: George, there's no traffic at this time. Now, come on, man...
GEORGE: Really?
KRAMER: If anything, we'll probably get there early. I'll have a chance to go to the Duty Free shop.
GEORGE: The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?
KRAMER: Duty.
GEORGE: Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much duty is?
KRAMER: No, I dunno how much duty is.
GEORGE: Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...
KRAMER: I still like to stop at the duty free shop.
GEORGE: I like to stop at the duty free shop.
(They start to "sing", growing more excited after each iteration:)
GEORGE & KRAMER: I like to stop at the duty free shop!
I like to stop at the duty free shop!
[Meanwhile, back on the plane, Jerry and Tia are chatting (isn't that always the way? You get stuck beside someone who insists on going on and on about their kids and how their life didn't go according to plan and all that boring dreck...]
TIA: So, he says, ``squeeze your breasts together'', and I say, ``I thought this was an ad for shoes''...
JERRY: Oh my...
TIA: Is that the new Esquire? Turn to page 146.
JERRY: Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?
TIA: See those wrinkled jeans slung over the chair? Way in the background, out of focus?
JERRY: Uh-huh...
[In traffic, Kramer and George are surrounded by honking cars and what is obviously heavy traffic]
KRAMER: How does it look on your side? [Pause while George just stares at him] We'll get there...
[Back in, ugh, *coach* (those heathens), the annoying guy is sleeping beside her while the woman on her other side is reading a book. Elaine is looking rather, shall we say "pensive". She talks to herself]
ELAINE: Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.
[On the bright side, Kramer and George arrive at the airport. They're running to the terminal:
GEORGE: They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!
KRAMER: Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like a man! Lift your knees!
(They find an arrival/departure screen)
GEORGE: Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.
KRAMER: No, there it is, right there-- 133... and it's canceled.
GEORGE: Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!
KRAMER: Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket counter.
(A bearded man comes up to the screen before they go)
GROSSBARD: Oh, there it is honey, gate 18A, 8:30... [He leaves]
KRAMER: Did you see that guy?
GEORGE: No... What guy?
KRAMER: That guy.. He was just...
GEORGE: Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!
KRAMER: [still lost] I know that guy...
(We cut to the airport gift shop where a man in handcuffs and shackles is being led around by two FBI-looking types)
PRISONER: Gotta get my Time magazine... Never miss my Time magazine.
GUARD: Yeah, get your magazine and let's get out of here.
(George lifts the last copy from the rack before the con can get it.)
PRISONER: Hey, I was gonna take that!
GEORGE: Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.
PRISONER: I don't care when you got here, I want the magazine...
GEORGE: You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!
PRISONER: A *blurb*?!? *You're* a blurb! Check out the cover, idiot!
GUARD: All right, let's go...
(George checks out the cover shot which shows a picture of the aforementioned prisoner with the caption ``Caught!'' written below.)
PRISONER: I want the magazine!
GEORGE: Umm... No.
PRISONER: You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles...
GEORGE: But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!
(Kramer comes into the gift shop and does a Krameresque double-take at "that guy" from the departure screen who's browsing books. He goes up to George.)
KRAMER: They're on a different flight. They're scheduled to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.
GEORGE: Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...
KRAMER: Where do I know that guy from?
[Elaine is still pining for the guy next to her to wake up so she can go to the bathroom.]
ELAINE: [To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...
(Elaine scurries off to the bathroom, Jerry and Tia are enjoying some hot towels on their faces.)
JERRY: Oh my... that *is* refreshing...
ATTENDANT: Would you care for some slippers?
JERRY: Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?
TIA: Please!
JERRY: Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.
(They chortle to themselves and tink glasses (no, that's not a cleverly- masked euphemism). Back in the car...)
GEORGE: My name is not mentioned in this blurb...
KRAMER: It's Grossbard!
GEORGE: Who's Grossbard?
KRAMER: When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street 20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent. Then one month, he asks me to loan him his share of the rent-- 240 bucks! He took the cash and >pfffft< disappears. Well, I try to find him, I went to his girlfriend's house, even his family. Uh-uh. I never got the money back! He screwed me! And that's the guy-- John Grossbard!
GEORGE: Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...
KRAMER: No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get that guy...
GEORGE: No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.
[Elaine is still waiting to get into the bathroom-- there's someone in there. *Finally*, a ZZ Top reject comes out of the bathroom and, to paraphrase Jerry in "The Smelly Car": ``I open the door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits me--''. Elaine takes in a lungful of air and goes in. Brave little soldier.]
[Jerry comes back from the *first class* washroom]
JERRY: Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.
ATTENDANT: They're gardenias, mostly.
JERRY: I thought I smelled lilac.
ATTENDANT: Yes, there are a few of those, too...
TIA: It's almost overwhelming...
(The captain interrupts)
CAPTAIN: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've been instructed by the tower to re-route and land at JFK. We apologize for any inconvenience...
(Elaine exits the bathroom, exasperated and curiou)
ELAINE: [To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?
[Back to George and Kramer at Laguardia; George has been inside to see if Jerry and Elaine are there, he reports his findings back to Kramer in the car.]
GEORGE: Well, You're not gonna believe it...
KRAMER: What?
GEORGE: The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.
KRAMER: Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- it tolls for thee.
(Kramer peels out.)
[In first class, Jerry and Tia get the lowdown on the grub]
ATTENDANT: We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, my personal favourite. Or, if you prefer something lighter, a poached Dover sole in a delicate white wine sauce with just a *hint* of saffron.
JERRY: Oh, saffron! That sounds good.
ATTENDANT: And today we're featuring wines from the *Tuscany* region...
JERRY & TIA: Tuscany!
(They do that "tink" thing again, and we rejoin Elaine going back to her seat, but the other attendant is serving the slop to the unwashed masses in coach and he's in her way.)
ELAINE: Hi. Can I get to my seat?
ATTENDANT: You're just gonna have to wait...
ELAINE: But you just passed it. I'm sitting right there next to that guy...
ATTENDANT: You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
ELAINE: Well, nobody *told* me that!
ATTENDANT: Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot of people to serve. Now please... You're just gonna have to wait.
[Back at JFK, George and Kramer check out the Arrivals board (again)]
GEORGE: There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
KRAMER: Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I *still* got time to catch him!
GEORGE: How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.
KRAMER: Gimme your credit card.
GEORGE: My credit card?
KRAMER: Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.
GEORGE: I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!
KRAMER: I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on that flight.
GEORGE: What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.
KRAMER: No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna get my money, I'll get off the plane and turn your ticket in for a refund. It's not gonna cost you a dime! Now gimme the card.
GEORGE: This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.
[Back in coach, Elaine returns to her seat now that the attendant is done serving.]
ELAINE: Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me get through. There's no way to get around that cart...
PASSENGER #1: You're not supposed to get up during the food service.
ELAINE: I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?
PASSENGER #1: He asked me where you were, and you were gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats.
ELAINE: Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.
ATTENDANT: Are you sure?
ELAINE: Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.
ATTENDANT: Would you? Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal.
ELAINE: Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.
PASSENGER #1: I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected it, or something.
PASSENGER #2: No, no. It all has to do with the way they kill the pig.
PASSENGER #1: They don't eat pigs!
PASSENGER #2: They do if it's killed right-- under a Rabbi's supervision.
PASSENGER #3: Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher meal.
ELAINE: Then why didn't you take it?
PASSENGER #3: I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot.
ELAINE: You're eating my food!
ATTENDANT: Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you want it, or not.
[Jerry and Tia enjoy a dessert treat]
JERRY & TIA: Mmmmmmmm!
TIA: This is the best sundae I've ever had.
JERRY: Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.
TIA: I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
JERRY: Thank you...
JERRY & TIA: Mmmmmm!
(We get a quick shot of Elaine staring at *something* on the end of her fork with a decidedly unimpressed look. Back in first class)
ATTENDANT: More anything?
JERRY: More everything!
[Back at JFK]
KRAMER: Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.
GEORGE: Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
GEORGE: You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!
KRAMER: She talked me in to it-- she said it was the best deal.
GEORGE: Do you know how much this is going to cost me?
KRAMER: Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with you
GEORGE: Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...
(Kramer goes forward and confronts Grossbard. For his part, Grossbard doesn't seem to recognise Kramer from twenty years ago (then again, he apparently had short hair at the time). After trying in vain to reach Grossbard's wallet, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Before this can take place, George knocks on the bathroom door to a reply of ``Just a minute'' from the occupant inside (I bet he stinks). Anyway, the door opens and, surprise! It's the Prisoner without his Time magazine (at least now we know why he needed it so badly-- reading material for the john). Anyway, the guy pulls George into the bathroom (he's still wearing his cuffs and shackles, BTW (that's got to make it rather difficult to go to the bathroom, but I digress)). So, while George is in the can with the serial killer, Kramer is escorted off the plane. Don't worry-- the plane isn't moving yet. And what's up with going to the bathroom on a non-moving plane? Isn't there laws against that? Or is it just trains that you have to wait until they're moving? Who really cares, anyway?)
[Elaine sneaks into first class. She just gets settled into a comfy seat complete with pillow, when all of a sudden]
ATTENDANT: Excuse me... Excuuuse me...
ELAINE: What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.
ATTENDANT: What is your name?
ELAINE: Elaine Benes?
ATTENDANT: [Checks her list] You're going to have to go back to coach.
ELAINE: No, but there was nobody sitting here...
ATTENDANT: Yes, but you're still not allowed. These seats are very expensive.
ELAINE: Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!
ATTENDANT: You're going to have to go back to your seat!
ELAINE: Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!
(The outburst has awoken Jerry and Tia who are sharing a blanket and napping)
JERRY: What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?
ATTENDANT: Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first class.
JERRY: Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.
(They return to snuggling)
[Kramer is being escorted through the airport by a security guy. He tries to talk his way out]
KRAMER: Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
(He breaks free and makes a run for it and seemingly escapes.)
[Jerry is getting ready for deboarding and he glances out the window only to see a rather harried Kramer running, arms flailing out on the runway. He takes a second look, just to be sure.]
JERRY: Couldn't be...
(After they get off the plane, Jerry & Elaine look for the boys and get their baggage)
JERRY: Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.
ELAINE: Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...
[In Honolulu, Elaine's bag appears to be having a good time, revolving around the baggage thingy, complete with lei.]
ELAINE: The worst flight I have been on in my entire life.
JERRY: Yeah, me too...
(He seems so sincere. Tia walks by, along with an entourage of photographers.)
TIA: I'll call you.
JERRY: Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business thing...
(Enter the K-man through the ramp where the baggage comes out)
KRAMER: You guys ready?
JERRY: Yeah. Where's George?
[We go to a shot outside the plane looking in on a rather roughed up George Costanza. He screams]
GEORGE: (can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!
[Ending Monologue]
But I have to admit, I like flying. I like those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time you go in there. The worst way of flying, I think is "standby", you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they call it standby-- you stand there going ``Bye!'' So I was on this flight where the flight attendant-- it was her first day on the job so they didn't have a uniform for her yet, and that really... makes a big difference, I mean this is just some regular person coming over to you going ``Would you mind bringing your seat back all the way up?'' It's like, 'Who the Hell are you?!''
[Jerry's Apartment]
GEORGE: I loved her Jerry, I loved her.
JERRY: No, you didn't.
GEORGE: And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.
JERRY: No she didn't.
GEORGE: What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?
ELAINE: [OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like her.
GEORGE: Who says?
ELAINE: You did.
GEORGE: Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.
JERRY: You walk around with no underwear?
GEORGE: Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?
JERRY: I do a wash.
GEORGE: Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, Jerry. No one's better than her.
JERRY: When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
GEORGE: I loved her!
JERRY: You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being taken to a cell.
GEORGE: I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.
GEORGE: I gotta call her. Should I call her?
JERRY: George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?
GEORGE: Whyie?
JERRY: You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.
GEORGE: I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe with.
JERRY: No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the woman.
ELAINE: Dana Folley.
JERRY: Right, Dana Folley.
GEORGE: She any good?
ELAINE: Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?
GEORGE: Wa, uh, ...
ELAINE: Tia? Who's that?
JERRY: She's the model I met on the plane.
ELAINE: She sent you a Christmas card?
JERRY: Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
GEORGE: My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!
(They ignore George)
JERRY: What are you doing?
ELAINE: ... date with Fred.
JERRY: The religious guy?
ELAINE: He's not THAT religious.
JERRY: Let us pray.
(Kramer Enters)
KRAMER: Hey, you got any Double Crunch?
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Kramer, should I call Susan?
KRAMER: Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta listen to the little man.
GEORGE: My little man doesn't know.
KRAMER: The little man knows all.
GEORGE: My little man's an idiot.
ELAINE: See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.
KRAMER: You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can do that for you. ...
GEORGE: She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.
ELAINE: No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture on a card.
KRAMER: No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.
GEORGE: She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what she put in those eggs.
KRAMER: All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal and I'll take your picture.
ELAINE: Really? Can you really take a picture?
JERRY: Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment over there.
ELAINE: All right, ha ha
KRAMER: I don't know about that outfit though.
ELAINE: Why? What's wrong with it?
KRAMER: Well, we'll have to improvise.
(Elaine and Kramer exit)
GEORGE: (singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...
JERRY: George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
[Change of Scene Tia at Jerry's]
JERRY: So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right here.
TIA: Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?
JERRY: Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush them down the toilet.
TIA: That's horrible!
JERRY: What's that perfume you're wearing?
TIA: oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today.
JERRY: What is that smell?
TIA: It's here somewhere.
JERRY: It smells like the beach.
TIA: Exactly.
JERRY: Oh my God is that the new perfume?
TIA: Yeah.
JERRY: I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.
TIA: Are you sure?
JERRY: And you're the model for this perfume?
(Noise)
JERRY: Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]
KRAMER: Hey
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]
JERRY: Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.
KRAMER: I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
JERRY: All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.
KRAMER: Hello.
(Jerry pushes Tia back away from Kramer)
KRAMER: How tall are you?
TIA: Five ten.
KRAMER: Come on lets see - Back to Back.
JERRY: NO! Kramer!
KRAMER: What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall she was.
JERRY: Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference who's tall. We're all tall.
KRAMER: What's that?
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: That smell. What's that smell?
JERRY: (starting the Dust Buster) What smell?
KRAMER: It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very familiar.
JERRY: Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] Now if you'll excuse us, ..
KRAMER: Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?
JERRY: Okay.
KRAMER: Yeah. Nice meeting you.
TIA: Nice meeting you too.
JERRY: I'll see you later.
(Kramer slowly leaves as Jerry shuts door on him)
JERRY: Ooow, that was close.
KRAMER: [OC] THE BEACH!!!
(enters)
KRAMER: You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? you're wearing.
TIA: It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.
KRAMER: CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach.
JERRY: I know look at this [shows ad]
KRAMER: Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not going to get away with this.

(George enters)
DANA: Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about you. Please sit down.
GEORGE: Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with this thing?
DANA: So uh, she broke up with you? ...
GEORGE: Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?
DANA: It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break up with you?
GEORGE: What is with this damn zipper?
DANA: It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your girlfriend.
GEORGE: It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth out.
DANA: It doesn't matter, so ...
GEORGE: This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, ...
DANA: George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. ... What's your girlfriend's name?
GEORGE: ... Susan.
DANA: Okay, we're getting somewhere.
GEORGE: UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new jacket.
[Jerry's Apartment]
ELAINE: Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work for that Church on Amsterdam.
JERRY: Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at what we have here. (mail). A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
ELAINE: It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
JERRY: I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
ELAINE: Well, you know. It's a picture?
JERRY: Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
ELAINE: Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?
JERRY: ... um ...
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
ELAINE: Carefully?
JERRY: Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong but I think I see ... a nipple.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Here. Take a look. What, what is that?
ELAINE: (gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.
JERRY: That's what I thought.
ELAINE: That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.
JERRY: DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
ELAINE: Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their own personal shot of it.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey!
ELAINE: Have you seen the card?
KRAMER: What card?
ELAINE: This car.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.
ELAINE: Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
KRAMER: No.
ELAINE: Well come here and take a look.
KRAMER: Yeah, so?
ELAINE: So, what's that?
KRAMER: That's a nipple.
ELAINE: Right!!
KRAMER: Ooo!
ELAINE: Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?
KRAMER: Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,
ELAINE: It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.
JERRY: Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.
ELAINE: No. I don't want him looking.
JERRY: Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.
ELAINE: Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.
[Jerry enters with Newman]
NEWMAN: Okay. What is it?
JERRY: Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.
NEWMAN: Your nipple's showing.
JERRY: Okay. Thanks.
NEWMAN: Anything else?
JERRY: No.
NEWMAN: All right. See you later.
JERRY: What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.
KRAMER: I got them too.
JERRY: Everybody's got them.
[Therapist's Office]
DANA: You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped underneath and it's ...
GEORGE: Pull it up a little bit.
DANA: Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had it.
GEORGE: Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.
DANA: No. Let me try...
GEORGE: Take it right off the chest...
DANA: Ugh, ..
GEORGE: You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
DANA: YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have to stop.
GEORGE: Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. ... Oh,Elaine?
DANA: Yeah.
GEORGE: (stares at card)
[Jerry's car - BMW]
[Jerry scratching right side of nose. Tia in a cab sees him, in shock. Cab pulls away.]
JERRY: No, No, No, No, Oh, No.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry hanging up phone)
JERRY: Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned one call.
GEORGE: Was it a scratch or a pick?
JERRY: It was a scratch.
GEORGE: Hey. It's me.
JERRY: Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and a scratch?
(Buzzer)
JERRY: Yeah?
ELAINE: (OC) It's me.
JERRY: Come on up.
GEORGE: Was there any nostril penetration?
JERRY: There may have been some incidental penetration. But from her angle she was in no position to make the call.
GEORGE: So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so then what?
JERRY: Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?
GEORGE: I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.
JERRY: Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue going out with her?
GEORGE: No. That's disgusting!
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] Oh please!
GEORGE: Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.
ELAINE: You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas card.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Got any Double Crunch?
JERRY: yeah. I think I do.
KRAMER: What's that perfume?
ELAINE: What, Ocean.
KRAMER: That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.
JERRY: I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me in a pick at a light.
KRAMER: I thought you said it was a scratch.
JERRY: But that's not what she thinks.
GEORGE: Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of town and she didn't get the calls.
JERRY: All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.
KRAMER: Let's go.
[Monk's]
GEORGE: It'll be different this time.
SUSAN: I need someone a little more stable.
GEORGE: I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? Costanza!
SUSAN: People don't change.
GEORGE: I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there and I'm loving it.
SUSAN: I'm not a soft boiled egg.
GEORGE: And I am not a piece of toast.
SUSAN: I just don't think we have anything in common.
GEORGE: That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.
SUSAN: Why were there so many cockroaches?
GEORGE: Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments [grins]
SUSAN: And they got along?
GEORGE: Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!
[Trump Towers]
KRAMER: I want to talk to Calvin.
SECRETARY: You can't go in there.
KRAMER: Let me talk to Calvin.
[Kramer enters office]
TIA: Kramer?
KRAMER: Yeah, uh.
CALVIN KLEIN: Who are you?
KRAMER: I'm here to talk about the ocean.
CALVIN KLEIN: Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves]
KRAMER: Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.
CALVIN KLEIN: Neither do I.
[Outside office]
JERRY: Hello there you are.
TIA: What are you doing here?
JERRY: Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been returning my calls.
TIA: Well, I've been busy.
JERRY: Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that you caught me (flustered, he indicates a nose pick)
TIA: (Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this..
JERRY: But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
TIA: I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators)
JERRY: But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There ws no piick!
TIA: I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry)
JERRY: No! No pick!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Calvin Klein's office]
(Kramer, standing, is talking with Klein)
KRAMER: All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..
KLEIN: (Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face..
KRAMER: Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.
KLEIN: You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful.
KRAMER: Well, yeah.
KLEIN: Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular..
KRAMER: You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.
KLEIN: You're spectacular.
KRAMER: (Flattered) Oh?
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine's office]
(Elaine's fighting with her boyfriend, Fred, about her Christmas card)
ELAINE: I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took it.
FRED: (Incredulous) Soo - what happened?!
ELAINE: Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button it.
FRED: I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
ELAINE: Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts it on speakerphone) Yeah?..
RECEPTIONIST: Your sister, Gail.
ELAINE: Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.
CO-WORKER: (Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need that manuscript or can I take it home?
ELAINE: Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was an accident! Well.. well.. it's gotta be somewhere. Look under his mattress.
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Susan's apartment building]
(George and Susan are slowly making their way up the stars to Susan's apartment. He's treating it very much like the long walk to an execution; she's mellow and happy)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Calvin Klein's office]
(A couple people are sitting with Klein, and talking. Kramer is no where in sight)
WOMAN: About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. He's wearing only dress shoes, socks, and his briefs) My.. he's sexual, athletic.. an' without a trace of self-consciousness!
KLEIN: His buttocks are sublime!
MAN: Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose we could get him into the weight room.
WOMAN: (Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the studio today. We can send these out immediately.
(Kramer casually puts his hand on the wall, attempting to lean on it, but the corner is rounded, and he slides along it, eventually falling down. Fortunately, the other people don't notice - they're talking amongst themselves)
MAN: You've done it again, C.K.!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Calvin Klein office building]
(In a hallway, Tia and others are waiting for the elevator. Jerry, deciding to make a speach, starts to preach to the crowd)
JERRY: An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending myself but all those Pickers out there who've been caught. (Elevator doors open) Each an' every one of them, who has to suffer the shame and humiliation because of people like you.. (Everyone but Jerry is now in the elevator. Jerry's still addressing them) Are we not human?! If we pick, do we not bleed?! (Elevator doors shut. A few people in the hallway are looking at him, he turns and addresses them) I am not an animal!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine's office]
(Elaine's standing in the doorway, yelling at Fred)
ELAINE: I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!
(Scene ends)
[Monk's]
GX: So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. The pick.
JERRY: The pick?
ELAINE: The pick?
GEORGE: She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You should have seen the look on her face.
JERRY: I think I've seen that look.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
JERRY: Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.
GEORGE: Your buttocks are spectacular.
ELAINE: Oh my!
KRAMER: What?
ELAINE: I'm not sure but... I think I see your...
[Opening monologue]
What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters? Didja ever notice, they never hire anyone between the ages of fifteen... and eighty, you know what I mean? Like, the girl that sells you the ticket, she's ten. Then there's the guy who rips the ticket, he's a hundred and two. So, what happened in the middle, there? You couldn't find anybody? It's like they want to show you how life comes full circle. You're fifteen, you sell the tickets. Then you leave, you go out, you have a family, kids, marriage, career, grandchildren, eighty years later, you're back in the same theater three feet away. Ripping tickets. Took you eighty years to move three feet.
% A night at the Improv. Jerry receives some disturbing news from the manager: The show has been delayed.
JERRY: You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another spot across town at 9:50, I'm not gonna be able to make it!
% As impeccable and precise in his business dealings as he is with his apartment.
KERNIS: I hear you, guy.
JERRY: And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out the material!
% In the background is the plot complication of the week: Buckles. The manager assures Jerry that Buckles isn't on the menu. He just hangs around hoping that somebody drops out.
KERNIS: Why don't you come back and do the 11 o'clock spot?
JERRY: No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate'' at 10:30.
% On consideration, Jerry decides to take the 11 o'clock spot and skip the movie. Jerry is on his way out the door when Buckles spots him.
BUCKLES: Hey, Jer!
JERRY: [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]
% At the Paragon Theater, George joins the end of a queue. He taps the shoulder of the man in front of him.
GEORGE: Excuse me, do you have a ticket?
MAN: No.
GEORGE: Okay. Good.
% Misunderstanding number one: When Jerry shows up at the other comedy place, the manager tells him his spot was for 9:15, not 9:50. The manager had no choice but to give Jerry's spot to...
BUCKLES: Jerry!
JERRY: What are <you> doing here?
BUCKLES: Hey, do you think this is funny? ``Why do they call it athlete's foot? You don't have to be an athlete to get it. I mean, my father gets it all the time, and believe me, he's no athlete!''
% And you're no Jack Kennedy. Jerry is understandably unimpressed. He tries to escape, but Buckles won't let him. Jerry is on his way to the theater to tell his friends he can't make it, then back to the Improv. Buckles offers to join him and split the fare. ``I've got time! It'll give us a chance to know each other a little better!'' Elaine joins George in the queue.
ELAINE: I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.
GEORGE: Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.
ELAINE: ``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!
GEORGE: ``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!
ELAINE: Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the end, where they're all splashin' around, and then they go running over to the mirror to see if it really worked? I mean, come on! [laughing too hard to continue] That's stupid!
GEORGE: Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror and saw that he hadn't changed, and that tear started to roll down his cheek? ... I lost it.
% Apparently, a movie that can be interpreted on two levels. Misunderstanding number two: Kramer joins George and Elaine after looking for them at the Paradise Twin around the corner. Elaine hates the Paradise because it's a multiplex; she'd rather see a movie on a big screen. Something catches Kramer's eye.
KRAMER: Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.
GEORGE & ELAINE: No, wait!
GEORGE: You're not going to get back here in time!
KRAMER: I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!
ELAINE: You can get a hot dog in the theater.
KRAMER: I don't wanna get a movie hot dog! [in tears] I want a Papaya King hot dog!
ELAINE: Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then this line is going to start moving, and we're going to end up in the front row.
KRAMER: Well, just save me a seat.
% This touches a raw nerve.
ELAINE: No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that! I once had the fleece just ripped out of my winter coat in a seat-saving incident!
% Kramer just asks for his ticket, but George doesn't have them.
GEORGE: I'm in line to buy.
ELAINE: No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.
GEORGE: No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.
ELAINE: Then how come we're not moving?
KRAMER: Good question.
% George addresses the man in front of him.
GEORGE: Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?
% George gloats, knowing what the answer is going to be.
MAN: Holders.
% Instant double-take.
GEORGE: But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said no!
MAN: I didn't. My friend was getting it.
GEORGE: [furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.
% Misunderstanding number three. George goes to get tickets, leaving Elaine and Kramer to talk behind his back.
ELAINE: Can you believe him?
KRAMER: He's spaced out.
% Let him who is without sin, Kramer.
ELAINE: How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?
KRAMER: [thinks for a while]
ELAINE: [gives up] Yeah, exactly...
% The movie has sold out. ``Real good, George. Real good.'' It's now 10:20, and Kramer suggests they go watch the 10:45 showing of "CheckMate" at the Paradise. Elaine enters whine mode.
ELAINE: I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!
GEORGE: It's the same movie! What's the difference?
ELAINE: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in POWs to show them propaganda films.
% But she gives in. New plan. George and Elaine will get tickets at the Paradise, while Kramer waits at the Paragon to tell Jerry of the change in plans. But Kramer can't keep his eye off the Papaya King sign, flashing, beckoning, practically begging... Jerry suffers through Buckles' telling of his life story in the taxi.
JERRY: [to taxi driver] Take the Park!
BUCKLES: No no no, take 55th.
% Jerry can't stand it. Buckles somehow drifted onto the subject of fish and how much he hates it.
BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to do me a favor. No more fish!
JERRY: [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end] Okay, I get your point!
BUCKLES: I had a point?
% At the Paradise, George succeeds in obtaining the tickets, and he joins Elaine in the ticket-holders line. (Right?)
GEORGE: Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
ELAINE: Sigh/Ugh.
GEORGE: I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.
ELAINE: Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
GEORGE: So what's your point?
% Yeah, what's your point?
GEORGE: By the way, you owe me seven fifty.
ELAINE: Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?
GEORGE: No, I don't have any change.
ELAINE: Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.
GEORGE: Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.
ELAINE: Yeah, you *could*...
GEORGE: Might be easier.
ELAINE: I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe me twelve fifty instead of me owing you seven fifty.
GEORGE: [trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other, but we know better] Either way.
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: So... Can I have it?
ELAINE: I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.
GEORGE: Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?
ELAINE: I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.
GEORGE: I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy *you* a popcorn and soda, and I'll throw in a bon-bons.
ELAINE: [exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.
% The line begins to move. George offers to wait outside for K+J.
GEORGE: You go in and save seats.
ELAINE: [in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save three seats! I told you about that guy who tore up my winter coat!
% With extreme reluctance, Elaine goes on ahead to save seats.
% The taxi is stuck in traffic. Jerry bawls out Buckles for choosing 55th on a Saturday night. Buckles considers how various famous people would react to be stuck in traffic, using Jerry as an unwilling guinea pig for his material.
BUCKLES: Jerry, I want you to have this piece of material.
JERRY: That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.
BUCKLES: Jerry! Don't start up with me!
JERRY: I gotta get out of this cab...
BUCKLES: But Jerry, quit riffing!
JERRY: No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the difference?
BUCKLES: [pause] Can you help me get on The Tonight Show?
% Apparently, not.
[Elaine does her best to save three seats.]
ELAINE: No, these are saved.
MAN: All of them? C'mon, you can't take *four* seats.
ELAINE: What, is that a rule?
% George comes in; J+K haven't appeared. Elaine sends George to the Paragon to give Kramer his and Jerry's tickets. Throughout the conversation, Elaine fends off would-be claim-jumpers.
GEORGE: Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You said you didn't like saving anyway.
ELAINE: [stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her] No, *TAKEN*, Taken, taken. [to George] [shrugs] I'm getting the hang of it.
% George returns to one of his favorite topics.
GEORGE: Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get change, and then you and I can... uh... you-know, settle.
ELAINE: Can we do this later, George?
GEORGE: Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly takes her hand and pats it] You'll give me the money when you have it. [takes two steps, then reconsiders, then re-reconsiders] I, I trust you.
% Kramer stands, mesmerized by the sign that reads, ``100% pure fresh beef. Tastier than Filet Mignon.'' He rushes to the ticket booth.
KRAMER: Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot eleven, he's got uh a big head and flared nostrils, tell him his friend's going to be right back, okay?
% Elaine is accosted from all sides.
ELAINE: No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ... They're in the lobby buying popcorn. ... What are you doing? These are taken, these are taken!
WOMAN: Which one?
ELAINE: These two and this one. ... No! Don't come over here! These are taken. Go! Go! These are taken! They're taken! THEY'RE TAKEN!!!
% She can't take it any longer.
ELAINE: Oh, take 'em.
% George reaches the ticket booth of the Paragon.
GEORGE: Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face, big teeth, and a, and a pointed nose?
CLERK: ... flared nostrils?
GEORGE: Yeah.
CLERK: Nope, haven't seen him.
% George leaves, unsuccessful.
[Jerry gets out of the cab in front of the Paragon.]
BUCKLES: Jerry, could you do me a personal favor? And if I'm out of line, *please*, let me know. Could I keep my trench coat in your closet for a few months?
JERRY: Your trench coat in my closet?
% It's not like he's asking for a ride to the airport or anything.
BUCKLES: Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills, I'm afraid to open the door. Just for a few months. It'll make all the difference in the world.
% Jerry sanely declines. Jerry doesn't see any of his friends, so he figures they're inside. He'll go in to tell them he can't join them.
BUCKLES: We should see ``Rochelle Rochelle''. I hear it's really hot.
JERRY: No thanks, maybe some other time.
BUCKLES: Really? Do you really mean that?
JERRY: No, I don't.
% Brutal honesty once again saves the day.
BUCKLES: You liked the athlete's foot bit, right?
JERRY: No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.
% Jerry pays his half of the fare then approaches the entrance to the Paragon.
JERRY: Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to 'em. Mind if I walk through real quick?
USHER: [indicates ``okay'']
% Just after Jerry goes inside, Kramer clomps to the ticket booth at warp speed, clutching a precious Papaya King hot dog in his hand.
KRAMER: Hey, did that guy show up?
CLERK: The guy with the... horse face... and the big teeth...
KRAMER: No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.
CLERK: Haven't seen him. There was a short guy with glasses... Looked like Humpty-Dumpty with a melon hat. But he left.
% Behind Elaine, a women chats loudly with her friend.
WOMAN: So I got home, and he was vacuuming! I mean, he's twelve years old! Who else but my Alan would do something like that?
WOMAN: And then last night, he put on my high heels. Oh, he put on such a show for us! He was dancing around, lip-sync'ing to ``A Chorus Line'', I mean you can see he's got talent.
ELAINE: [annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.
WOMAN: What's the problem?
ELAINE: [momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident] You're talking.
WOMAN: It's the ``Coming Attractions''.
% Elaine collects her things and leaves.
WOMAN: So anyway, he sings, he dances. And do you know what he's gotten into now? He is cooking! He does a crepe...
% At the entrance to the Paradise Twin, George is stopped by the usher.
USHER: Ticket, sir?
GEORGE: Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?
USHER: Do you have your stub?
GEORGE: [as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?
USHER: Mm hm.
% George sifts through his pockets, going on about how he never needed a stub before.
GEORGE: You don't remember me?
USHER: It's a big city, sir.
GEORGE: I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big wall o' hair, face like a frying pan?
% Unable to find his stub, George gives him Kramer's ticket. The ticket-taker tears the ticket and gives George the stub. George goes into the ``CheckMate'' theater just as Elaine leaves it through the other door. Like two dips, passing in the night.
GEORGE: [whispering] Elaine? [loud whisper] Elaine! [louder whisper] Elaine!
% Various movie patrons tell George to shut up.
GEORGE: [quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!
% He is quickly shouted down, making his escape through the exit. The exit to the street.
[In the theater at the Paragon, Jerry whispers ``Elaine'' and, hearing no response, gives up.]
NARRATOR: The Village Voice calls it a masterpiece. A young woman's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
% Something about this preview attracts Jerry's attention. Not sure exactly what, though...
NARRATOR: It's a story about life. And love. And becoming a woman. ``Rochelle Rochelle'', now playing at Paradise 2.
%Meanwhile, Kramer gives up waiting outside the Paragon. Seconds thereafter, Jerry rushes out of the theater and hails a cab. Or tries to.
[Elaine reaches the concessions stand and has to deal with the perky clerk.]
ELAINE: Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?
CLERK: Do you want the Medium size or the middle size?
ELAINE: What's the difference?
CLERK: Well, we have three sizes. Medium, Large, and Jumbo.
ELAINE: [momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?
CLERK: There is no small. Small is Medium.
ELAINE: What's... medium?
CLERK: Medium is Large, and large is Jumbo.
ELAINE: Oh-kay. Gimme the large.
CLERK: That's medium.
ELAINE: Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small popcorn?
CLERK: There is no small. [flash of perky inspiration] Child-size is small.
ELAINE: What's `medium'?
CLERK: Adult.
ELAINE: Do adults ever order the child-size?
CLERK: [chuckling] Not usually.
ELAINE: [laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.
CLERK: Do you want butter?
ELAINE: Is it *real* butter?
CLERK: [perkily] It's butter-*flavored*!
ELAINE: [exasperated] What is it made of?
CLERK: [perkily] It's yellow!
% Leaving the inanities of modern marketing aside, we switch to Jerry, still outside trying to hail a cab. He finally gets one. The driver speaks with a Russian accent.
JERRY: 44th and 9th.
DRIVER: Have you got a cigarette?
JERRY: No.
% George once again tries to get past the ticket-taker.
USHER: Ticket, sir?
GEORGE: We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just had this exact same conversation a minute ago!
USHER: I need to see your stub.
GEORGE: [realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got the stub.
% George empties his pockets in a quest for a ticket stub. No dice.
GEORGE: There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket. You happy now? You got two tickets.
% George goes past the concessions stand, not seeing Elaine, who is searching her pocketbook for change to pay for her popcorn and drink.
USHER: Ticket, sir?
KRAMER: Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket. I'm late, and she's inside.
USHER: Go ahead.
% George dwells at the ``Rochelle Rochelle'' sign for what must be the 5th time this episode. Kramer heads straight into the theater.
KRAMER: Is that seat taken?
Woman Behind ELAINE: It's all yours.
% Kramer lankily stumbles into the seat, but finds the fit uncomfortable.
Driver: I'm very sorry, you give me few minutes. I have to stop for gasoline.
JERRY: Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?
DRIVER: [taken aback] No! Impossible! It is on `Empty'!
% Jerry nervously glances at his watch.
(Elaine returns to the theater, arms laden with popcorn and soda, trying to find her seat. Various patrons tell her to sit down already. She is finally shouted down and pushed out of the aisle, causing her to spill most of her popcorn in the process. George sits in a half-empty theater watching ``Rochelle Rochelle''. Not a female audience member in sight.)
MAN: You're soaking wet. Who are you?
ROCHELLE: My name is Rochelle, I'm from Milan. I'm supposed to visit my relatives in Minsk.
MAN: Here, stand by the fire. Take off those wet clothes, you'll catch cold.
ROCHELLE: Oh, my hand's so cold, I can barely get these buttons open.
% George is clearly waiting to see Rochelle's other buttons.
ROCHELLE: Oh, that's much better. Much...
(A tall man sits down in front of George, blocking his view of Rochelle's Christmas cards. Elaine stumbles to the ticket-taker, trying to shake popcorn out of her hair.)
ELAINE: I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn] I just went to get popcorn, okay? And and and somebody took my seat, and my coat is in there!
USHER: There's a seat in the front row.
ELAINE: No no, I can't sit in the front row.
USHER: Well, you're going to have to wait, then.
ELAINE: I can't stand around here for *two hours*!
USHER: I could let you see ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
ELAINE: [heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.
% Elaine plods off, then realizes she had something else to say.
ELAINE: Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky... doofus, with a, with a bird-face and hair like the Bride of Frankenstein?
USHER: Haven't seen him.
% Meanwhile, at a service station, the taxi driver assures Jerry that they will be leaving very soon. He'll just go across the street to buy a cigarette.
% From his pocket, Kramer digs into his treasured Papaya King hot dog. Then discovers the source of his discomfort: He's sitting on a coat.
JERRY: Hey, did I make it?
KERNIS: Sorry.
JERRY: Oh, great. That's great. What a night.
% Off-screen, we hear appreciative applause.
ANNOUNCER: Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen. Another round of applause for Pat Buckles!
% Jerry spots Buckles.
JERRY: You got my spot?
BUCKLES: That athlete's foot bit killed!
JERRY: Really...
BUCKLES: Do you think I need to lose some weight?
JERRY: Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.
JERRY: My whole night's ruined. I didn't do any sets, didn't do any movies...
BUCKLES: Come on, we can still catch most of ``Rochelle Rochelle''.
JERRY: ``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?
BUCKLES: A young girl's strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
JERRY: [his interest piqued] Minsk?
% George and Elaine watch ``Rochelle Rochelle'' in different parts of the theater. Also there are Jerry and Buckles. George and Buckles seem to be enjoying the movie; Jerry and Elaine can't deal with it.
ELAINE: Oh, gimme a break!
% George turns, as does Jerry.
JERRY: Elaine?
% Elaine's face lights up.
ELAINE: Jerry!
JERRY: Elaine!
VOICE: [whispered] Shut up.
GEORGE: Jerry?
JERRY: George?
GEORGE: Elaine?
ELAINE: George! [waves hi]
% Another prized Seinfeld moment, soon to be copycatted around the country.
JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?
VOICE: [whispered] Will you shut up?
ELAINE: I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!
JERRY: Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.
BUCKLES: You're leaving?
JERRY: Yeah.
% The music from the movie continues over the next, heart-rending scene...
BUCKLES: [holding out his coat] Jerry, take the coat. Please. One month.
JERRY: I don't want the coat.
BUCKLES: Jerry! Call me when you get home so I know you're okay!
% Jerry, Elaine, and George fill each other in on their respective miseries out in the lobby.
GEORGE: [studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum. Oh, by the way, you owe me seven fifty.
JERRY: I didn't even use the ticket!
GEORGE: I still paid for it!
% Kramer wanders out of ``CheckMate'', his newly-found coat draped casually over his shoulders. Jerry looks through his wallet.
JERRY: I only have a twenty.
ELAINE: That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?
KRAMER: It was on the seat...
ELAINE: *YOU* took my seat!?
GEORGE: You uh owe me for the ticket.
KRAMER: Yeah, right...
ELAINE: What is that stain [on my coat]?
KRAMER: It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?
[Closing Monologue]
I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the plot. It's embarrassing. It's an embarrassment to have to admit, but I'm the one that you see in the parking lot after the movie talking with his friends, going: ``Oh, you mean that was the same guy from the <beginning>... Ohhhhhhhhhh...'' Nobody will explain it to you. When you're in the theater, you can't find out. [whispering to imaginary friends seated around him] ``Why did they kill that guy?... Why did they kill him?... Who was that guy? What was the... I thought he was with them? Wasn't he with them? Why would they kill him if he was with them? Oh, he wasn't *really* with them.... I thought he was with them. It's a good thing they killed him.''
[Opening monologue]
What are lawyers, really? To me a lawyer is basically the person that knows the rules of the country. We're all throwing the dice, playing the game, moving our pieces around the board, but if there's a problem, the lawyer is the only person that has read the inside of the top of the box. I think one of the fun things for them is to say, "objection." "Objection! Objection, your Honor." Objection, of course, is the adult version of, "Fraid not." To which the judge can say two things, he can say, "overruled" which is the adult version of "Fraid so," or he could say, "sustained," which is the adult version of "Duh."
[George is at the counter at Monk's, he's talking with an Oriental woman.]
GEORGE: So you're a lawyer. What kind of cases do you handle?
CHERYL: Oh, everything. Divorce, patents, immigration and naturalization.
GEORGE: What is that, immigrants come over, you show them how to act natural?
CHERYL (laughing) Are your friends as funny as you?
GEORGE: No, they're not funny at all. No, I have no funny friends. I'm the funny one. El Clowno.
(Quick pan to the front door as Jerry and Elaine are entering.)
ELAINE: Look, I was nice enough to pick it up for you
JERRY: Hey, I've been back four days, I want my mail.
ELAINE: It's mostly bills, magazines and junk mail anyway.
JERRY: Elaine, that's what mail is. Without bills, magazines and junk mail, there is no mail.
(Cut back to George and Cheryl at the counter.)
CHERYL: Here's my card.
GEORGE: Oh, ok. Thank you. It was good talking to you.
CHERYL: Nice meeting you.
GEORGE: Yeah.
(Cheryl leaves, George walks over to the booth to meet Jerry and Elaine.)
ELAINE: Hi!
JERRY: Hey, how ya doin?
GEORGE: You would not believe what just happened. I was waiting for you and this woman was sitting at the counter.
ELAINE: What, the one who just left?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, and we started talking, and she's this lawyer who's incredible! Everything I said was funny! You know, she laughed at everything I said, she thinks I'm hilarious. You know in a way, it was almost too good. I started so good, I can't go any place but down now, ya know? I got no place to go.
ELAINE: Yeah, well, I guess it's all over.
JERRY: (looking behind the counter) Hey, is that Babu? It is! (walking over) Hey, Babu!
BABU: Jerry!
JERRY: Look at you, you got the job.
BABU: Yes, yes, they give me job thanks to you.
JERRY: Oh, I didn't do anything.
BABU: Yes, you do everything, get me job, you get me a place to live in your building.
JERRY: Come on.
BABU: You very very good man, you do everything for me. My family and I can never thank you enough for everything you do.
(Cut back to George and Elaine.)
GEORGE: You see, this is what I do with women. I start out too strong, now I have to become real, that's when it all falls apart. What good is real? They don't want real, they want funny.
ELAINE: No they don't.
GEORGE: Ooooh, yes they do.
ELAINE: Nooo.
GEORGE: Ya gotta put on a show, ya always gotta give them a big show. You always have to be 'on' otherwise why would they like me? They'd just go for a better looking guy with more money.
(Elaine nods her head in approval.)
GEORGE: You mean that's true, I'm right?!
JERRY: Ok, great, well, I'm glad everything worked out, Babu.
BABU: Oh, yes, yes, everything wonderful.
JERRY: Ok, I'll see you around the building.
BABU: I'll see you *in* the building.
JERRY: (returning to the table) Remember Babu Bhatt?
GEORGE: Who's he?
JERRY: Remember that guy who opened the restaurant across the street from the building last year and he wasn't doing so well and I told him he should make it into all Pakistani and that drove him right out of business? So, you uh, going with me to the auto show with me Saturday?
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.
JERRY: Can you bring my mail then?
GEORGE: What mail?
ELAINE: I picked up his mail while he was on the road
GEORGE: Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
JERRY: Cause he's at that baseball fantasy camp in Florida.
GEORGE: Oh yeah, right. When's he coming back?
JERRY: Monday, I think.
GEORGE: Kramer goes to a fantasy camp. His whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two-thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors and have sex without dating; that's a fantasy camp.
JERRY: Hey listen, if you're gonna go out with this lawyer, why don't you have dinner with us and then maybe you can go to the auto show with her if you want, you know, have a little company, take the pressure off.
(George has a dream sequence where the four of them are at a dinner table and Cheryl is laughing hysterically at one of Jerry's jokes.)
JERRY: ...he never heard of corduroy!
CHERYL: (howling with laughter) Stop it, you're killing me!!
JERRY: He never heard of corduroy! True story, true story.
(Dream sequence ends.)
GEORGE: No, no I don't think so.
ELAINE: Why?
GEORGE: Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.
JERRY: I don't know why you want to play man-to-man when you could play a zone.
GEORGE: She might not be comfortable.
ELAINE: Why? We're all very nice, we're very friendly.
JERRY: We'll be funny.
GEORGE: No! No. It's not good, I don't think so.
ELAINE: Alright, well if you change your mind, we'll wind up as Isabella's probably around seven.
JERRY: No, no Isabella's, I don't want to go to Isabella's.
ELAINE: Why?
JERRY: No, it's too trendy, no Isabella's.
[George and Cheryl are at Isabella's.]
GEORGE: (tasting the wine) Excellent. Like I really know what I'm talking about.
(Cheryl laughs.)
GEORGE: Toasting makes me uncomfortable. But toast, I love. Never start the day without a good piece of toast. In fact, let's toast to toast.
(Just then the headwaiter seats Jerry and Elaine at the next table.)
JERRY: Look who's here! Georgie-boy!
GEORGE: What are you doing here? I thought you said you hated Isabella's?
ELAINE: No, I talked him into it.
GEORGE: What happened to the auto show?
JERRY: Oh, we're still going, we're still going. Elaine, do the spokes model.
ELAINE: The turbo quadramatic transmission offers you the power and prestige to propel you well into the 21st century.
(Jerry and Cheryl laugh, George, unamused, tries pushing Jerry and Elaine away from their table.)
ELAINE (to Cheryl, who's rising to shake her outstretched hand) Hi.
GEORGE: Cheryl, Elaine, and uh, Jerry.
JERRY (shaking hands in turn) Hi, nice to meet you.
CHERYL: Would you like to join us?
GEORGE: Oh no no no, they don't want to join us.
CHERYL: Oh no, it's ok, don't be silly.
ELAINE: Ok, well why don't we just put these two tables together?
GEORGE: (as the others are repositioning the tables) No, no, you can't do that, they're round, it makes an 'eight' and, yeah, well alright.
ELAINE: Jerry? Jerry, tell them that funny story you were telling me--
GEORGE: No! No.
ELAINE: No George, it's so funny. We saw this cab driver's picture, right?
GEORGE: (interrupting) You know we should really order, the service is so slow here, by the time you get anything...
ELAINE: Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you a legal question? Um, I'm being sued.
CHERYL: Oh? What happened?
ELAINE: Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin and I crossed against the light and I knocked over the delivery boy.
CHERYL: Was he Chinese?
ELAINE: Yeah.
CHERYL: Is your last name Benes?
JERRY: How did you know?
CHERYL: Ping is my cousin!
ELAINE: No!
JERRY: That's so funny!
CHERYL: I'm handling his case!
ELAINE: What? You're Cheryl Fong?
CHERYL: That's right!
(By now, they're all laughing.)
ELAINE: Oh my god, I can't believe it! That is such a coincidence!
CHERYL: Yeah, I know!
ELAINE: Wow, well, I guess you don't have any advice for me on how to win the case?
CHERYL: Will you excuse me? I have to make a call.
ELAINE: Tell Ping I said hello.
JERRY: Tell him you think you may have broken the case wide open.
(They all laugh as Cheryl walks away.)
GEORGE (suddenly not laughing) What are you doing? What are you doing?
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: This is not good. This is not good.
JERRY: What's the matter?
GEORGE: I just don't think it's such a great idea for you to sit here.
JERRY: Why not?
ELAINE: He thinks that if you're too funny, he might not look so funny.
JERRY: Biff?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: You're not worried about that?
GEORGE: No, of course not.
JERRY: I mean, so what if I'm funny? Who cares?
ELAINE: He thinks that if a woman sees a guy put on a better show, she'll walk out on his show, go see the other show.
JERRY: Well, should we leave?
GEORGE: Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
ELAINE: This is so ridiculous. Can we just go over there?
JERRY: I don't have to be funny, I don't care.
GEORGE: You don't?
JERRY: No way! It's completely under my control.
ELAINE: No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
JERRY: Of course I can, am I being funny now?
ELAINE: A little.
JERRY: Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: George, is this funny?
GEORGE: It's funny! (To Elaine) and it wouldn't kill you to not be so funny either.
ELAINE: What? What did I do?
(Cheryl returns.)
GEORGE: Hi.
JERRY: (subdued, almost somber) Hello. Welcome back.
CHERYL: Sorry, it was my aunt's birthday and she makes such a big deal about it.
ELAINE: Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
JERRY: Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year has gone by and how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake, we know it's not to be, that for the rest of our sad, wretched pathetic lives, this is who we are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably; happy birthday? No such thing.
GEORGE: Funny guy, huh?
[Elaine is bringing Jerry's mail to his apartment.]
ELAINE: Here, take it. I was glad to get rid of it.
JERRY: Well thank you very much, it's about time.
ELAINE: Oh listen, guess what? Cheryl convinced Ping to drop the case against me.
JERRY: Drop the case? Well, congratulations, that'll save you some money.
ELAINE: Yeah, no kidding. That lawyer was gonna charge me a fortune.
JERRY: (leafing through his mail) Oh great, a birth announcement from Arnie and Joy Harris.
(They hear a noise from the hallway.)
JERRY: Hear that? Guess who's back. (Opening the door) Hey!
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: I thought you weren't coming back till Monday.
KRAMER: Well, the camp ended a few days early.
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: Uh, well there was an incident.
JERRY: What happened?
KRAMER: I punched Mickey Mantle in the mouth.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Yeah, I punched him and they took him to the hospital and then they canceled the rest of the week.
ELAINE: You punched who in the mouth?
KRAMER: Mickey Mantle.
JERRY: What happened?
KRAMER: Well, you know, we were playing a game and, you know, I was pitching, and I was really throwing some smoke. And Joe Pepitone, he was up, and man that guy, you know, he was crowding the plate.
JERRY: Wow! Joe Pepitone!
KRAMER: Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants. Cause I gotta intimidate when I'm on the mound. Well the next pitch, he's right back in the same place. So, I had to plunk him.
JERRY: You plunked him.
KRAMER: Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him. I looked down, and woah man, it's Mickey. I punched his lights out.
JERRY: Wow, this is incredible!
(A voice is heard from the hallway.)
BABU: Leave me alone! You can't do this to me!
JERRY: What's going on out there?
BABU: What are you doing? This is not right, people. You're making a very bad mistake, very bad.
JERRY: Babu? (leaving) I'll be right back.
ELAINE: (to Kramer) Yeah, so?
KRAMER: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's screaming, "Mickey! Mickey! What have you done with Mickey? You killed Mickey!"
ELAINE: So what'd you do?
KRAMER: Well, I got the hell out of there.
JERRY (running back in) They took Babu away!
ELAINE: They took Babu away?!
JERRY: Yeah, the Immigration guy said his Visa was expired. Poor Babu, everything was going so well for him. He had an apartment, he had a job. What a shame.
BABU (calling from the street) Jerry! Jerry! Help me!
JERRY: I will, Babu! I will help you, Babu, don't worry!
KRAMER: Then Hank Bauer, you know, he's chasing me around, he trips over third base and knocks over Clete Boyer.
JERRY: (thumbing through his mail) Uh oh.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Well this is interesting.
ELAINE: What is it?
JERRY: It's a letter from the Immigration Bureau, it's Babu's Visa renewal application form. They must have put it in my mailbox by mistake.
KRAMER: Well, doesn't he need that?
[Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: If you had given me my mail last week when I got home, this whole thing never would have happened.
ELAINE: Well, you should have come to my house to pick it up.
JERRY: Yeah, so am I being funny now?
ELAINE: No, actually, you're not being funny now.
JERRY: See, I told you I wasn't funny all the time. (George enters) Hey George, look, I'm not funny now.
GEORGE: No, and you weren't funny last night either. In fact, you got us both so depressed, she asked me to drive her home after dinner.
JERRY: Oh look, I need to get in touch with Cheryl. Babu needs a lawyer, his Visa's expired.
GEORGE: What do you need her for? There's a million lawyers.
JERRY: Yeah, but you said this is one of the things that her firm does.
GEORGE: Alright, alright, but no funny business, same deal as last night.
JERRY: Ah, will you stop it already?
GEORGE: Jerry, please?
JERRY: How long is this gonna go on?
GEORGE: Till I'm comfortable.
JERRY: Well, when is that gonna be?
GEORGE: After consummation.
JERRY: Consummation? I don't think you have enough material.
[Jerry and Cheryl are at the coffee shop.]
CHERYL: I actually have a friend in the Immigration Department who owes me a big favor. You're very lucky.
JERRY: (somber) That's wonderful news. Thank you.
CHERYL: You're a very serious person, aren't you?
JERRY: Well, with so many people in the world deprived and unhappy, it doesn't seem like it would be fair to be cheerful.
CHERYL: I understand.
(Jerry reaches for the milk for his coffee.)
CHERYL: I think it's curdled.
JERRY: I don't care.
CHERYL: Do you ever laugh?
JERRY: Not really. Sometimes, when I'm in the tub.
CHERYL: That's so sad. What do you do?
JERRY: I'm a comedian. Oh, let me get that. (reaching for the check) You've been so helpful.
ELAINE: (entering as Jerry heads to the register) Hey, we're gonna go see Babu now, right?
JERRY: Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm just gonna go say hi to Cheryl. (walking over to the booth) Hi.
CHERYL: Hi.
ELAINE: Listen, gosh, I wanted to thank you so much for convincing Ping to drop the case.
CHERYL: Well, after we met, you were all so nice. I just couldn't go through with it. But between you and me, you would have paid through the nose.
ELAINE (laughing) You're kidding.
CHERYL (laughing) No, I'm not.
[Jerry and Elaine are at the Immigration office.]
JERRY: Babu!
BABU: Jerry! Jerry, hello Jerry!
JERRY: You remember Elaine.
BABU: Yes, yes of course!
ELAINE: Nice to meet you.
BABU: So nice of you both to come.
JERRY: Oh, Babu.
BABU: No no, you're both very kind, very kind.
JERRY& ELAINE (in unison) Oh, well, you know.
ELAINE: We try.
JERRY: We do what we can.
ELAINE: We do what we can.
BABU: The problem is I never got my Visa renewal form in the mail. I was expecting it.
JERRY: Yes, well, see, here's the thing, Babu. Um, what happened was I was away for a couple of weeks doing some comedy shows.
BABU: Comedy shows! You're a very funny man.
JERRY: Well, Elaine here was picking up my mail while I was away, because you know that little box can get very full.
BABU: Oh yes, of course. TV Guide, magazines, everything. You know, I would have picked up your mail, your box is right next to mine.
JERRY: Oh, I don't want to bother you.
BABU: No bother! You get me job, you get me apartment, you very very good man.
JERRY: So yesterday, after they took you away, I looked in my mail and I noticed that the mailman accidentally put your Visa renewal in my mail box.
BABU: Come again?
JERRY: You see, I've been home for a week and Elaine didn't give me my mail until yesterday, even though I asked her repeatedly for it.
ELAINE: Yeah, but Babu, he could have come to my house to pick it up.
BABU: You had my Visa application?!
JERRY: Well not technically.
BABU: (extremely and suddenly agitated) I kill you!!
JERRY: Well what about her?
BABU: I kill both of you!!
JERRY: Babu?!
BABU: No Babu! No Babu! You bad man! You very bad man! You very lazy bad man!
JERRY: Babu, I'm gonna fix everything! I have a lawyer who knows someone in the Immigration Department, they're gonna straighten the whole thing out, the wheels are in motion, things are happening even as we speak!
BABU: The wheels are in motion?
JERRY: The wheels are in motion, things are happening!
[George and Cheryl are parked.]
GEORGE: Jerry?
CHERYL: I'm very attracted to him.
GEORGE: You think the person you were talking to is him? That's not even close to him. He's funny, Jerry's funny.
CHERYL: He never said anything funny.
GEORGE: He can't not be funny.
CHERYL: No no no, he's dark. And disturbed.
GEORGE: Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.
CHERYL: So you're telling me Jerry's whole thing was an act?
GEORGE: Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.
CHERYL: I gotta go.
GEORGE: Well, should I call you later?
CHERYL: Please don't.
GEORGE: But, but I'm disturbed! I'm depressed! I'm inadequate! I got it all!!
[Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment.]
ELAINE: So, what's up with Babu? How come he's not back?
JERRY: I don't know, I don't understand it. Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it, he should be back by now. (Answering the buzzer) Yeah?
GEORGE: It's George.
JERRY: C'mon up.
(They hear a voice in the hallway, Jerry opens the door.)
JERRY: Babu must be back.
BABU'S BROTHER: Babu, my goodness, what has happened to you?
JERRY: Where's Babu?
BABU'S BROTHER: He is in Pakistan!
JERRY: Who are you?
BABU'S BROTHER: I am his brother. He knew a lawyer, it was all going to be fixed.
JERRY: I'm sure the lawyer did everything they could.
BABU'S BROTHER: Then where is Babu? What happened to Babu? Show me Babu!
ELAINE: (offering a drink) Snapple?
BABU'S BROTHER: No, too fruity.
(Babu's Brother leaves, George enters.)
JERRY: Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl was gonna help Babu get his Visa.
GEORGE: She didn't help him?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: Where is he?
JERRY: He's in Pakistan.
GEORGE: Oh boy.
JERRY: What do you mean, oh boy?
GEORGE: Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.
JERRY: Told her the truth? Well, you got Babu deported.
GEORGE: What do you mean, I got? You didn't give him his Visa application.
JERRY: That's because she had my mail.
(Kramer enters.)
ELAINE: Yeah, well I wouldn't have had to get your mail if he hadn't gone to that fantasy camp.
KRAMER: Well, I just came back from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
JERRY: How could you go in there?
KRAMER: Well, I had to. I had to apologize. I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle, my idol. It was eating me up inside!
JERRY: Well, what happened?
KRAMER: I got down in my knees and went, "Go ahead, Mickey. Hit me. I'm begging you, Mickey, please hit me. C'mon, hit me. I love you, Mickey, I love you!"
ELAINE: So, what did he do?
KRAMER: Well, the four of them, they picked me up by my pants and they threw me outside, right into a horse.
(There's a knock on Kramer's door.)
VOICE: Kramer?
KRAMER: Yeah? It's my Chinese food.
(Ping enters with a bag of food.)
ELAINE: Oh! Ping! Hi! Listen, thank you so much for dropping that lawsuit against me.
PING: Not anymore.
ELAINE: What?
PING: Cheryl call me last night, lawsuit back on.
ELAINE: Why?
PING: She call you and your friends big liars. You think she nice girl? Wait till you see her in court. She's a shark! They call her the Terminator. She never lose a case. Now you make her mad. She double the damages. Hasta la vista, baby.
(Ping exits.)
[Babu and a friend are sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe in Pakistan]
BABU: So his friend got the mail but she did not give it to him. And then he came to visit me. Said the lawyer was called to help, he said the wheels were in motion, but there was no motion. There was nothing. And so they sent me back here.
BABU'S FRIEND: This is a terrible story, Babu. What are you going to do?
BABU: I'm going to save up every rupee. Someday, I will get back to America, and when I do I will exact vengeance on this man. I cannot forget him. He haunts me. He is a very bad man. He is a very very bad man.
[Closing monologue]
I am for open immigration but that sign we have on the front of the Statue of Liberty, 'Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...', can't we just say, 'Hey, the door's open, we'll take whoever you got.'? Do we have to specify the wretched refuse? I mean, why don't we just say, 'Give us the unhappy, the sad, the slow, the ugly, people that can't drive, that they have trouble merging, if they can't stay in their lane, if they don't signal, they can't parallel park, if they're sneezing, if they're stuffed up, if they're clogged, if they have bad penmanship, don't return calls, if they have dandruff, food between their teeth, if they have bad credit, if they have no credit, missed a spot shaving, in other words any dysfunctional defective slob that you can somehow cattle prod onto a wagon, send them over, we want 'em.'
[Open Monologue]
The basic problem with the beginning of the relationship, I think, is that each person has their own sexual time-table of what should happen when, that the other person knows nothing about. That's why I really think we need some sort of sexual rulebook, where it's written down and agreed upon - sexual, standard, dating procedure. Know what I mean? So if there's any problems, you can go, (takes a small booklet out of his inside pocket) "Look, honey, I'm very sorry, but we've been out three times, and according to Article 7, Section 5, there's got to be some physical contact, as you can see." (Gestures to the booklet.) "Otherwise, I will report you to the board, and they can put out a warrant for an embrace."
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry and George, working on the script for the "Jerry" pilot episode.)
GEORGE (writing on a notepad): Wait a second, wait a second...and then the butler says, "I'm not cleanin' it up! I'm sick of cleaning!"
JERRY (copying it down and grinning): That's funny, that's funny! "I'm sick of cleaning." That's very funny.
GEORGE (laughing): I'll tell you something, I've never seen a pilot script as funny as this!
JERRY: Yeah, it's funny!
GEORGE: I mean, how funny is this?
JERRY (low voice): It's funny.
GEORGE: I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!
JERRY: It cannot not be funny! Now come on, let's stay with it, we gotta finish this today.
GEORGE: Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe I'll give it to Elaine.
GEORGE: Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.
JERRY: Right, right. Okay. (Writing) Elaine enters.
GEORGE: Right
JERRY: (Thinks) What does she say...?
GEORGE (thinking): I don't know, what do women say?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.
JERRY: You know, if we bring Elaine in, it's going to be so many people to keep track of. It's gonna be too hard, I'll forget where everybody's standing, you, me, Kramer, the butler, it's too much.
GEORGE: Alright, forget Elaine.
JERRY: Alright. (They tear the pages out of their notepads. Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER (to Jerry): You are never gonna believe who I just ran into today.
JERRY: Who?
KRAMER: Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.
JERRY: Did you talk to her?
KRAMER: Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?
JERRY: So what happened?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) "Oh, hi! Kramer!" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.
JERRY: Yeah, I know about the three dates.
KRAMER: You know what I did? I snubbed her.
JERRY: What do you mean, you snubbed her?
KRAMER: I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.
JERRY (smiling): Right by her?
KRAMER: Right by her!
JERRY (to George, hugs Kramer happily): What you do say about a guy like this, huh! (George applauds.) You are some great friend, I tell ya, snubbed her! (seriously) Not that I condone it. I've never condoned snubbing in my administration. But your loyalty is beyond question.
KRAMER: Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.
[Monk's]
(Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is showing her the script.)
ELAINE (throws the script at Jerry): I'm not even in here!
JERRY: Yeah, I know.
ELAINE: Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.
JERRY: Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...
ELAINE: You couldn't "keep track" of everybody?
JERRY: Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.
ELAINE: You have no idea?
JERRY: Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.)
GAIL (to Jerry): I thought I'd find you here.
JERRY: Well, Gail Cunningham.
ELAINE: Hi, Gail.
GAIL: Hi, Elaine. (To Jerry) Hey, what is with your friend Kramer?
JERRY: Why?
GAIL: He snubbed me.
JERRY: Are you sure?
GAIL: Yeah, I'm sure. What did you tell him?
JERRY: Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)
ELAINE: I thought you were finished.
JERRY: I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?
GAIL: So, how come? Why did Kramer do that?
JERRY: I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.
GAIL: Well, tell him that I am mad at him.
JERRY: Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?
GAIL: Pfeiffer's.
JERRY: Ah, the power lunch crowd.
GAIL (to Elaine): Nice shoes!
ELAINE: Oh. Thank you.
GAIL: Where'd you get 'em?
ELAINE (modest): They're um, Botticelli's.
GAIL (impressed): Ooh, Botticelli's! Look at you! I'm afraid to go in there.
ELAINE: Really.
JERRY: Would you care to join us?
GAIL: No, no, I gotta get to the restaurant. (Looks at her watch.) Oh! See ya. (Exits.)
JERRY: See ya.
ELAINE (irritated, imitates Gail): "Oh, look at you, the Botticelli's."
JERRY: That bothered you?
ELAINE: Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.
JERRY: It did?
ELAINE: Yes! Couldn't you see that?
JERRY (thinks): No. This is why you're not in the pilot.
[George in a session with Dana, his therapist.]
DANA: Well, George, I think you're beginning to get some perspective on things. I think we're making progress.
GEORGE: Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
DANA: Good. So, let's pick up on this next week.
GEORGE: Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?
DANA: Yes, yes I did.
GEORGE (beaming): Well, what'd you think?
DANA (unenthusiastic): Uh...it was...good.
GEORGE: You didn't like it?
DANA: Well, no, I -
GEORGE: I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?
DANA: It wasn't funny.
GEORGE: It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?
DANA: No, I didn't find it funny.
GEORGE: You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?
DANA: Well, that whole storyline about a guy who gets into a car accident, doesn't have any insurance, so the judge sentences him to be a butler? I didn't really buy that.
GEORGE: Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.
DANA: George, if you're going to be in a creative field, you're going to have to learn how to deal with criticism.
GEORGE: How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of "com-med-dee"! You sitting here, telling people what to do.
DANA: I think you'd better go.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!
[Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment. They're both standing by the door. Elaine enters.]
GEORGE (immediately, to Elaine): So, you send me to this therapist to help me with my emotional disorders, and she criticizes our script. (Tosses the script to Jerry.) What kind of a therapist is that?
ELAINE: I guess she didn't think it was funny.
GEORGE: Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!
JERRY: I thought your mother's paying for it.
GEORGE: And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, "Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person."
JERRY (to Elaine): You know, he's right. It's not her place to criticize the script, which reminds me - what did you think of it? You never told me.
ELAINE: What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.)
KRAMER (to Jerry): Hey, buddy, I got something to tell ya. (Elaine runs towards to the bathroom in lieu of answering Jerry's question.)
JERRY (catches Elaine): Hey, one second, you don't get off that easy. C'mon, tell me what you thought.
ELAINE: Well, you know, I...
KRAMER: I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)
JERRY: You what?
KRAMER: Yeah, I kissed her.
JERRY: You kissed her?
KRAMER: Right on the mouth.
JERRY: What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?
KRAMER: Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)
JERRY: And what did she do?
KRAMER: She kissed me back.
JERRY: I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?
KRAMER (realizing): Because I snubbed her. You see? Women, they like that! Yes! I understand women. The snub is good, they love the snub!
GEORGE: No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)
KRAMER (to Elaine): Ooh, so...I understand you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
ELAINE: What? Who told you that?
KRAMER: Gail Cunningham.
ELAINE: I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?
KRAMER: Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.
ELAINE (angrily): "How I'm buying my shoes now at Botticelli's!" Did you hear this? (Shoves Jerry and Kramer.)
JERRY: So what?
ELAINE: So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)
[Gail cooking in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's Restaurant. Elaine marches in.]
ELAINE: Hey! Gail!
GAIL: Ya. (noticing it's Elaine) Elaine...!
ELAINE: Why are you talking about my shoes?
GAIL: What?
ELAINE: My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.
GAIL: What are you talking about?
ELAINE: Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.)
WAITER: Too spicy. He wants another one. You got that pasta primavera?
GAIL: Look Elaine, I am very busy here.
ELAINE: Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!
GAIL: I am not discussing this. This is insane.
WAITER: You got that pasta primavera? Let's go!
GAIL: Ya ya ya, here.
(Gail passes the plate to the waiter in front of Elaine. Elaine sneezes on it. The waiter brings the pasta to the dining room and serves it to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC.)
WAITER: Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.
RUSSELL: Thank you.
WAITER: Sorry for the delay. Enjoy your lunch.
[Jerry and George arrive at Dalrymple's apartment to discuss the script.]
RUSSELL (opening the door): Well, come in. (They shake hands.)
JERRY & GEORGE: Hi.
RUSSELL: Awfully sorry to make you come up here, but I really wasn't feeling well enough to go back to the office, and well, it's the only chance I have to meet with you this week.
JERRY: Are you alright?
RUSSELL: Well, it's my stomach. I think there must have been something in the pasta primavera I had for lunch.
JERRY: Oh, Where did you eat?
RUSSELL: Pfeiffer's.
JERRY: Ah. I know the chef there.
RUSSELL: Yeah. The food's usually terrific.
GEORGE: My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.)
RUSSELL: What are you saying?
GEORGE: Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.
RUSSELL: Well, we'd better get started, my daughter's going to be here soon.
JERRY: Oh, you have a daughter?
RUSSELL: Yeah, she just turned fifteen last week.
GEORGE: Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)
RUSSELL: Alright. The script. Now, I've read this thing three times...and everytime I read it...(looks nauseous, struggles not to vomit.)
JERRY: What?
RUSSELL: Excuse me for a second. (Gets up and runs to the bathroom.)
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)
JERRY: I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?
GEORGE: Pasta primavera.
JERRY: Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'
GEORGE: No!
JERRY: Yeah.
RUSSELL (coming out of the bathroom): Really, I'm terribly sorry, it just, uh...all of a sudden it just hit me.
GEORGE: So, you were saying how, um...about the script...
RUSSELL: Right. The script. Your script needs some...it needs, um...(looks nauseous again. Gets up and runs to the bathroom a second time.)
GEORGE: More jokes?
JERRY: Another ending?
GEORGE: A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.)
JERRY: Maybe we should go.
GEORGE: We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)
RUSSELL (from bathroom): Oh God. Oh my god.
JERRY: I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)
MOLLY: Hello.
JERRY: Hi.
GEORGE: Hi.
MOLLY: I'm Molly.
JERRY: Oh, I'm Jerry.
GEORGE: George.
JERRY: We're here discussing our script with your father.
GEORGE: He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.)
MOLLY: Daddy? Are you okay?
RUSSELL (from bathroom): Yeah, yeah sweetie. I'm fine. (Molly sits on the back of the chair.)
GEORGE: So, you live with your mother, huh?
MOLLY: Uh, yeah.
GEORGE (to Jerry): Divorce is very difficult. Especially on a kid.
JERRY: Uh huh.
GEORGE: Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)
MOLLY: Daddy, are you alright? What's the matter?
RUSSELL: It's just a stomach thing.
MOLLY: Yuck.
RUSSELL (to Jerry and George): We're going to have to do this some other time, so if you'll give me your number, I'll call you later. (Jerry and George nod. Molly takes her jacket off.)
GEORGE: You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)
RUSSELL (angrily): Get a good look, Costanza?
[Jerry and George in Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: What were you doing?
GEORGE: Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!
JERRY: You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.
GEORGE: It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.
JERRY: Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
GEORGE: All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.
JERRY: That's why I poked.
GEORGE: That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)
GAIL: Hey! What is with your friend Elaine?
JERRY: What?
GAIL: She comes to my restaurant, comes right in my kitchen, and starts complaining that I'm talking about her shoes.
JERRY: She did?
KRAMER: Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.
GAIL: So, I don't want people coming into my kitchen. I think she might have sneezed all over someone's pasta primavera. Someone might have gotten sick because of her. (Kramer and Gail exit.)
GEORGE: Pasta primavera?
JERRY: Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.)
KRAMER (to Jerry): She's somethin', huh? She's a wild one. She's wearin' me out.
JERRY: She is?
KRAMER: She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)
JERRY: Hello? Oh, hi Stu.
GEORGE (lazily swinging the garbage bag around): From NBC?
JERRY: (to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)
[Jerry, George and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY (to Elaine): If you hadn't gone into her restaurant, this never would have happened.
ELAINE: Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!
GEORGE: He poked me!
JERRY: There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...
ELAINE: But she was fifteen.
JERRY: You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.
GEORGE: Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...
JERRY: You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.
GEORGE: Hey, now you're onto something.
JERRY: The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.
GEORGE: Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: But...somebody like Gail, though.
JERRY: Ya.
ELAINE: What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Yah-hey.
JERRY: Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.
KRAMER: Alright, I'll call her right now.
JERRY: Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.)
ELAINE (to George): What do you mean, Gail? You don't think I can attract attention? You don't think I can put asses in the seats?
JERRY: Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)
KRAMER: She said she'll do it.
GEORGE: Beautiful.
JERRY: Beautiful.
KRAMER (points at Elaine's feet): But she wants the shoes.
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: She says she wants those shoes.
ELAINE: She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!
JERRY: No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!
ELAINE: No, these were the last pair of these that they had!
JERRY: I'll get you another one just like it!
ELAINE: No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)
GEORGE (to Elaine, in a somber tone): Elaine, this pilot...it doesn't matter to me, it's not me I'm concerned about...it's my mother. I've been over to the hospital to see her...
ELAINE: Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -
GEORGE: Never mind!
ELAINE: Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?
KRAMER: Alright, what size are you?
ELAINE: Seven-and-a-half.
KRAMER: Eh! Bingo.
[Gail in the kitchen at Pfeiffer's. She notices Dalrymple being shown to his table.]
GAIL (hands a plate to another chef): Sauce this. (Goes to the telephone and dials.) Yeah, he's here. Oh, and one more thing...bring the shoes. (Hangs up.)
(Russell eating at the restaurant. Jerry and George arrive. Jerry hands the shoes to Gail, and they walk over to Russell's table.)
JERRY: Hey! Whattaya know!
GEORGE: Look who's here!
JERRY: Fancy meeting you here!
RUSSELL: Oh. Hello.
GEORGE (notices Russell's lunch): Pasta primavera! Back on the horse.
JERRY: You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.
GEORGE: Didn't hear anything...
JERRY: Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.
RUSSELL: Well, it just didn't seem to be the right project for us right now. (Elaine walks by in a low-cut dress. Jerry and George look at her as she moves to the table opposite Russell.) So, what were you saying?
GEORGE: Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?
JERRY: No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.)
ELAINE (to Russell): Uh, excuse me, are you using that ketchup?
RUSSELL (not noticing Elaine's cleavage): Uh, no. (Elaine takes the ketchup and goes back to her table.)
GEORGE: Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)
RUSSELL: Under the circumstances, I don't really feel that we should be in business together. (Elaine comes back over.)
ELAINE: Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?
RUSSELL (still not noticing Elaine's cleavage): No.
ELAINE (leaning forward): Do you have a...ketchup secret?
RUSSELL: No, I... (finally notices Elaine)...don't have a ketchup secret. (Smiles.)
ELAINE (flirtatiously): Because if you do have a ketchup secret, I would really, really like to know what it is. (Russell is pleased, and smiles at Elaine. Elaine goes back to her table, sits down, and waves at Russell.)
RUSSELL (to Jerry and George, reconsidering about the pilot): Field of vision, huh?
[Jerry, George and Elaine having dinner at Pfeiffer's. Gail comes over to the table.]
GAIL: How's everything?
ELAINE: Mmmm.
JERRY: Really good.
GEORGE: This pasta primavera is fabulous.
JERRY: Very tasty.
GAIL: How'd everything go with that NBC guy?
GEORGE: Great.
JERRY: The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?
ELAINE: You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.
JERRY: Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.
GEORGE: Well, it's a funny idea.
JERRY: It's funny!
GEORGE: C'mon, funny is funny.
JERRY: Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?
ELAINE: Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.
JERRY: If you can.
GEORGE: Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?
ELAINE: Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)
JERRY: I think what he's trying to say is, "get the bouilla-base." (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)
[Closing Monologue]
Men are obsessed with cleavage, women are obsessed with shoes. It's the same for both sexes. It doesn't matter how many times we've seen these things, every time these objects are presented to us we have to look, we cannot not look. To men cleavage i-i-is like the nearest thing to a nearby UFO landing, that's what it is. Women if women by a pair of shoes that they really love, this is like boarding the alien ship. I think that it's entirely possible that aliens have landed and they haven't been able to get our attention because we are so preoccupied with cleavage and shoes.
[Opening monologue]
I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending to be excited every time it's somebody's birthday, you know what I mean? What is the big deal? How many times do we have to celebrate that someone was born? Every year, over and over... All you did was not die for twelve months. That's all you've done, as far as I can tell. Now those astrology things where they tell you all the people that have the same birthday as you? It's always an odd group of people too, isn't it? It's like Ed Asner, Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.
[The scene opens with George dropping off his date for the night. She obviously has had a wonderful evening]
ALLISON: I don't want to *live*! I don't want to *live*!
GEORGE: Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to live because of me? I'm nothing!
ALLISON: No... You're *something*.
GEORGE: You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the window and hit someone better than me. I'm no good!
ALLISON: You're good. You're *good*!
GEORGE: I'm bad. I'm *bad*!
ALLISON: You're *killing* me!
[We cut to Monk's where George, Jerry & Elaine are dining (it being a diner, and all). Jerry is over making a phone call while George & Elaine talk at the table.]
GEORGE: So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She threatened to kill herself.
ELAINE: Over you?
GEORGE: Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?
(Cut to Jerry who is over at the phone trying to get Sharon Leanord at NYU. Elaine and George exchange thoughts on what they got Jerry for his birthday.)
GEORGE: I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".
ELAINE: I got him a two-line phone.
(Jerry returns to the booth and explains the phone call.)
JERRY: Unbelievable! She's not there.
GEORGE: What paper does she write for?
JERRY: The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student in journalism. Never been to a comedy club. Never even seen me, has no idea who I am.
ELAINE: Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...
JERRY: Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...
ELAINE: [Proudly] Really?
(The camera pans out some so that we can see the three at their table and a girl sitting with her back to George at the next table. She starts to become interested in what the people behind her are talking about as Elaine pops the following philosophical dilemma to her companions)
ELAINE: Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?
JERRY: Living or all time?
ELAINE: All time.
JERRY: Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins and ends with Brezhnev.
ELAINE: I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?
GEORGE: Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
ELAINE: I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up a tree.
(Elaine notices the woman sitting behind George is eavesdropping on their conversation and discreetly alerts J+G. She decides to add some spice to the conversation. The makes sure to say it loud enough so that the spy at the next table is sure to hear... )
ELAINE: Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what? I mean you should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.
(Jerry rolls his eyes and turns away in disbelief while George on the other hand addresses Jerry directly)
GEORGE: So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man I'll ever love.
JERRY: [indignantly] What's the matter with you?
GEORGE: [quietly] C'mon, go along...
JERRY: I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939 goose- stepping past me: "C'mon Jerry, go along, go along..."
JERRY: Y'know I hear that all the time.
ELAINE: Hear what?
JERRY: That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
ELAINE: Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.
JERRY: Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.
ELAINE: And you get along well with women.
GEORGE: I guess that leaves me in the clear...
(Meanwhile over at the phone booth, the eavesdropper reveals that she is one Sharon Leonard and she's calling the newspaper that she got to the diner late and missed out on meeting up with Jerry. As she's hanging up, George and Jerry make a trip to the bathroom (have two guys ever actually gone to the bathroom together? Hmmmm...)
[Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's unpacking groceries (no cereal to be seen) and George comes in.)
GEORGE: I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become a porno actor.
JERRY: Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?
GEORGE: Yeah, how did you know that?
JERRY: You told me that already like two months ago.
GEORGE: Allison bought it for me.
JERRY: How you gonna get out of *that* one?
GEORGE: I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.
(Sharon buzzes and comes up to Jerry's apartment. George decides to stay. There's a knock at the door and when Jerry answers it, the two decide if they've ever met before. It's pretty obvious Sharon remembers Jerry and George as that "funny" coup
