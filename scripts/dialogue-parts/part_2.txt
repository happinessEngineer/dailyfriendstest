JERRY: Oh, come on.
HELEN: This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
(knock on door: this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)
MORTY: Aha!
DORIS: So they arrived safely.
MORTY: (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
JERRY: Nice to see you. This is Elaine.
ELAINE: Hi. Nice to meet you.
JACK: So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?
ELAINE: And scuba diving.
HELEN: Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
JERRY: We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
HELEN: What do you have to go scuba diving for?
JERRY: For fun.
HELEN: For fun?
MORTY: Jack have some spong cake.
JACK: No. thanks, no.
MORTY: Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
JACK: So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skits tomorrow?
JERRY: I don't think so.
JACK: No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).
MORTY: What did you have? You had the minute steak?
JACK: Yeah.
MORTY: Did you have a coke or what?
JACK: I did NOT have a coke.
MORTY: Somebody had a coke.
HELEN: Oh I had a coke.
DORIS: And I had the scampi.
JACK: So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
MORTY: All right. Make it 20 bucks.
JACK: It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)
MORTY: 19.45$ ?
JACK: See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.
(Jerry notices Klompus's pen)
JERRY: What kind of pen is that?
JACK: This pen?
JERRY: Yeah.
JACK: This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.
JERRY: Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
JACK: Oh it was a gift.
JERRY: Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
JACK: Take the pen.
JERRY: Oh no.
JACK: Go ahead.
JERRY: I couldn't
JACK: Come on, take the pen!
JERRY: I can't take it.
JACK: Do me a personal favor!
JERRY: No, I'm not...
JACK: Take the pen!
JERRY: I cannot take it!
JACK: Take the pen!
JERRY: Are you sure?
JACK: Positive! Take the pen!
JERRY: O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
HELEN: Jack, what are you doing?
JACK: Stop it!
DORIS: Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice meeting you.
ELAINE: Mmm, nice to meet you.
JERRY: Thanks again.
JACK: Come on!
DORIS: (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)
HELEN: (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
JERRY: What he gave it to me.
HELEN: You didn't have to take it.
MORTY: Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
JERRY: He offered it to me.
HELEN: Because you made such a big fuss about it.
JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)
JERRY: He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
HELEN: He loves that pen.
MORTY: Oh come on!
HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.
JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet.
JERRY: Well, he was wrong.
HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (again we see Elaine smiling at their argument)
JERRY: So you want me to return it?
HELEN: Yes.
MORTY: He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
JERRY: Hey I don't even want the pen now!
MORTY: Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!
ELAINE: Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
(scene ends)
[setting: condo's guest room]
(Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall asleep)
(knock on door)
ELAINE: Come in.
JERRY: Are you O.K. in here?
ELAINE: Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
ELAINE: Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
JERRY: Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
ELAINE: I am never gonna fall asleep.
JERRY: Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
ELAINE: How can they not put the air conditioning on?
JERRY: They're nuts with temperature.
ELAINE: This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
JERRY: How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
ELAINE: I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(scene ends)
[setting: condo, morning]
(Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)
MORTY: Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?
JERRY: Stay on Biscayne.
HELEN: You're going underwater?
JERRY: Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
HELEN: What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?
JERRY: What's so special up here?
(Elaine open the guest room's door and she's in pain)
ELAINE: Oh!
(everybody get up and walk to her)
HELEN: What's the matter?
ELAINE: My back.
HELEN: What happened?
ELAINE: That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
HELEN: (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.
ELAINE: I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
JERRY: You can't go?
HELEN: So stay home.
ELAINE: You can go.
JERRY: Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
HELEN: Don't go.
JERRY: You sure?
MORTY: Maybe you should see a doctor.
JERRY: We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
ELAINE: (whispering to Jerry) Yes!
HELEN: No, we'll stay in there.
JERRY: Why don't you get a new sofa?
MORTY: Nobody uses it.
JERRY: I'm buying you a new sofa.
HELEN: Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.
ELAINE: Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
HELEN: You're hot?
ELAINE: I've lost 6 pounds.
HELEN: I don't even know how to work it.
MORTY: I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
(Evelyn, a neighboor, enters)
EVELYN: Is everybody up?
JERRY: Hi. How are you?
EVELYN: Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.
ELAINE: (with pain) Hi Evelyn.
EVELYN: Jerry you got thin.
JERRY: Too thin?
HELEN: Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
EVELYN: So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)
JERRY: (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
EVELYN: The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
HELEN: How did you know that?
EVELYN: Blanche told me.
HELEN: Blanche?
EVELYN: That's some good pen. It writes upside down.
ELAINE: The astronauts use them.
HELEN: What did Blanche say?
EVELYN: I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.
JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.
MORTY: He gave him the pen.
HELEN: Morty.
EVELYN: Why you don't like the pen?
JERRY: No, no, I...
EVELYN: Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.
HELEN: Is that what she said?
EVELYN: Who?
HELEN: Blanche.
EVELYN: What are you talking about?
(The phone rings, Helen answers.)
HELEN: Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)
ELAINE: Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
MORTY: (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
(the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.)
JERRY: All I said was "I like the pen".
(Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner)
MORTY: How the hell do you work this thing?
(scene ends)
[setting: still the condo, later]
(Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)
HELEN: Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
ELAINE: No no, I wanna go.
HELEN: But your back hurts.
MORTY: Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
ELAINE: Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
HELEN: No. I'm fine.
ELAINE: You're not too cold?
HELEN: No.
(Jerry enters with a black eye)
JERRY: Don't be alarmed.
MORTY: Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
JERRY: I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
HELEN: Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
JERRY: (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
ELAINE: Having a good time!
JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
HELEN: What happened to your eyes?
JERRY: Well I started to go under...
HELEN: With the instructor?
JERRY: Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
HELEN: I told you...
(Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar)
JACK: Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?
ELAINE: My back hurts.
JACK: Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
MORTY: We got plenty of time.
JACK: (to Jerry) What happened to you?
JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
HELEN: It's from scuba diving.
JACK: What's there to see underwater?
(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like: give him back the pen)
JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
JACK: You what?
JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
JACK: Well I mean...
JERRY: Take it.
JACK: All right! (he smiles and take it)
(Morty gets up and walks right to Jack)
MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.
JACK: Whose pen?
MORTY: His pen.
JACK: This happens to be my pen.
MORTY: You didn't give it to him.
JACK: What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?
JACK: Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?
MORTY: You said you didn't want it!
JACK: Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?
(Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing)
JACK: Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!
MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!
JACK: Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
MORTY: I don't want it!
JACK: I don't want it!
MORTY: You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!
JACK: Listen do you think I give a damn?
MORTY: Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that's it for them.
JERRY: What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)
JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.
JERRY: Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
ELAINE: (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
(scene ends)
[setting: reception room, evening]
(Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.)
PHOTOGRAPHER: Say astronaut.
(Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.)
ELAINE: Say what? (laughing) Say what?
JERRY: (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
MORTY: Astronaut?
HELEN: Say it.
JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN: Astronaut!
ELAINE: (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
(the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.)
MORTY: Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?
JERRY: Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
JERRY: (to Leo) Uncle Leo.
LEO: Hello!
STELLA: Morty are you nervous?
MORTY: What nervous?
LEO: (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?
JERRY: I've got a black eye.
STELLA: (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.
JERRY: Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
HELEN: (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
JERRY: (to Stella) Her back hurts.
STELLA: Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.
LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
JERRY: No, no.
LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.
ELAINE: (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.
MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.
(Jack and Morty exchange a look.)
STELLA: (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.
HELEN: (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.
(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells: "Hey Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)
JACK: (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.
MORTY: (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
JACK: Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)
HELEN: (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
JACK: His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.
MORTY: (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.
JACK: But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)
MORTY: (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)
JERRY: Dad!
MORTY: (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!
JACK: He gave it to me!
MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!
JACK: I'm not sitting down!
(they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight)
JACK: Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)
HELEN: Jerry, do your act.
JERRY: (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
HELEN: They're all gonna leave.
JERRY: (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
MAN IN THE CROWD: Who are you?
JERRY: (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
WOMAN IN THE CROWD: (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.
(Elaine is almost asleep at the table)
JERRY: Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
MAN IN THE CROWD: I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!
HELEN: (to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
JERRY: All I said was I liked the pen!
ELAINE: (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
(Everybody stops talking and put their hands on their ears)
(scene ends)
[setting: condo, morning]
(Elaine is sitting on the couch and a chiro is examining her. Jerry's sitting next to her. Helen is standing beside them and Morty is still asleep in the guest room)
CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravate it. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.
ELAINE: Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
JERRY: There must be some mistake.
CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not.
ELAINE: (discouraged) Five days. Here.
HELEN: (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!
JERRY: (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
ELAINE: Excuse me?
JERRY: Nothing.
(Evelyn enters)
EVELYN: Good morning.
JERRY: Hi Evelyn.
EVELYN: (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
HELEN: I don't think so.
EVELYN: Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.
HELEN: Well I'll ask him when he gets up.
EVELYN: Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.
(Morty gets up in a bad shape)
MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?
HELEN: I was very comfortable.
EVELYN: Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
HELEN: It's in the constitution.
MORTY: (to the chiro) Who are you?
CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor.
MORTY: What are you kidding me?
ELAINE: (to Jerry) Five more days?
JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
(scene ends)
[setting: night club, closing monologue]
JERRY: Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
[Opening monologue; Comedy Club.]
JERRY: So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
[New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated) man.]
GAVIN: Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel without him.
JERRY: Is he on the plane now?
GAVIN: Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?
JERRY: Uh, just my next door neighbor.
GAVIN: You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways that you never could have thought possible.
JERRY: Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
(Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.)
JERRY: What's the matter?
GAVIN: Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.
[Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.]
ATTENDANT #1: Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you to a hospital.
GAVIN: My dog. What about my dog?
ATTENDANT #1: Uh, you have a dog?
ATTENDANT #2: Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?
(Jerry stares out the window.)
GAVIN: Jerry?
JERRY: Huh? How you feeling?
GAVIN: Would you take care of Farfel?
JERRY: Farfel?
ATTENDANT #2: It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital, could you take his dog to New York?
JERRY: The dog? The dog??
GAVIN: I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
JERRY: But, you know, what if, you know?
GAVIN: Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.
JERRY: The dog?
[New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.]
JERRY: Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
ELAINE: Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
JERRY (to Farfel): STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.
ELAINE: If only.
JERRY: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
ELAINE: Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
JERRY: Do I what?
ELAINE: Do you pick it up?
JERRY: Yes, I pick it up.
ELAINE: You pick it up?!?
JERRY: Well you have to.
ELAINE: Oh, boy would I love to see that.
JERRY: SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
ELAINE: Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
JERRY: No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
ELAINE: No, milk.
JERRY: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
ELAINE: What is a bender anyhow?
JERRY: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
ELAINE: I can't believe he hasn't called.
JERRY: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
JERRY: Why?
ELAINE: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
KRAMER: I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
JERRY: You're breaking up?
KRAMER: Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
ELAINE: Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
KRAMER: Woah, you didn't like her?
ELAINE: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
JERRY: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
KRAMER: How come you never said anything?
JERRY: Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
KRAMER: I tell you.
JERRY: You. I'm talking about people.
ELAINE: Are we still going to the movies tonight?
JERRY: No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
ELAINE: Just me and George?
JERRY: Sure.
ELAINE: But we need you.
JERRY: What do you need me for?
(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)
ELAINE: Because... Yeah?
GEORGE: Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
(Elaine buzzes George into the building.)
ELAINE: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
JERRY: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
ELAINE: Just me and George alone?
(George enters.)
GEORGE: Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
JERRY: I can't go.
GEORGE: Can't go, Why not?
JERRY: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
GEORGE: I thought Kramer was watching.
JERRY: He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
GEORGE: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
JERRY: No, I don't want that smell in the house.
GEORGE: You spritz a little Lysol on it.
JERRY: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
GEORGE: So we're not going?
JERRY: Nah. You two go.
GEORGE: Oh. You still wanna go?
ELAINE: Do, do you?
GEORGE: If you want.
ELAINE: It,s, it's up to you.
JERRY: Go ahead.
ELAINE: Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
GEORGE: Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
JERRY: I want to but I can't.
ELAINE: Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: What about this--
JERRY: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
ELAINE: I know, it's not that.
GEORGE: It's just we want you to go.
JERRY: Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
[Comedy Club]
JERRY: On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
[New scene. George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De Leon. They're obviously uncomfortable alone together.]
GEORGE: So how long did you live there?
ELAINE: About three years.
GEORGE: That's pretty long.
ELAINE: Hmm.
GEORGE: It's not that long, really.
ELAINE: Yeah.
(An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same time, then stop. Another silence.)
GEORGE: And then you came here.
ELAINE: Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
GEORGE (Counting on his fingers): Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
[New scene. Jerry vs. Farfel, part II]
JERRY: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
[New scene. Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend.]
KRAMER: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
[New scene. Monk's, Elaine and George are as bored as before.]
GEORGE: I like herbal tea.
(Elaine yawns.)
GEORGE: Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
ELAINE: Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
GEORGE: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
ELAINE: Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
GEORGE: You don't tell him?
ELAINE (laughing): No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel great!"
GEORGE (laughing): You don't tell him?
ELAINE: No.
GEORGE: That is so funny!
ELAINE: I know!
GEORGE: Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
(They both make the same convulsive gestures together and break out in more laughter.)
[New scene. Kramer has had a change of heart.]
KRAMER: Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
[New scene. Jerry's at his apartment, on the phone, Farfel is barking.]
JERRY: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
[New scene. Jerry and Elaine are cleaning Jerry's apartment.]
ELAINE: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
JERRY: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
ELAINE: The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
JERRY (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay, see you in five minutes.
(Jerry hangs up the phone and begins singing and dancing.)
JERRY: Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
ELAINE: Do you have to?
JERRY: What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
ELAINE: You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
JERRY: I'm in the book and I have a machine.
ELAINE: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
JERRY: Really? How late are they open?
(Kramer enters.)
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: What is it?
KRAMER: I went back with Ellen.
JERRY and ELAINE: Ohhhhh, that's great.
ELAINE: Terrific.
JERRY: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
ELAINE: Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
KRAMER: Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
JERRY: Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
KRAMER: From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
JERRY: What are you doing?
KRAMER: I'm getting my pot.
(Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.)
ELAINE: Kramer, we like her.
JERRY: Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
ELAINE: I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
JERRY: I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
JERRY: Well.
ELAINE: Well.
JERRY: everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
GEORGE: Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
(Farfel begins barking.)
JERRY: Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
ELAINE: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
JERRY: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
ELAINE: Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
JERRY: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
ELAINE: We'll see it Sunday.
(George enters.)
GEORGE: Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
ELAINE: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
GEORGE: What does this mean?
JERRY: Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
GEORGE: What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
JERRY: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
GEORGE: Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
JERRY: I don't know, regular human time?
GEORGE: Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
JERRY: Why shouldn't I go here?
ELAINE: Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
GEORGE: And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
GEORGE: Hey, go.
ELAINE: Who's stopping you?
GEORGE: What, are you doing me a favor?
ELAINE: Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
(Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.)
GEORGE: How's it going?
ELAINE: Good. Good. You?
GEORGE: Things are good.
(After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.)
ELAINE: Boy, he takes such a long time.
GEORGE: I know.
ELAINE: You know what he does in there? He gargles.
GEORGE: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
ELAINE: Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
GEORGE: How come we never hear him?
ELAINE: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
(Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.)
GEORGE: Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
ELAINE: We talked about that already.
GEORGE: Oh.
[New scene. Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater.]
GEORGE: I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
JERRY: So what are calling me six times a day?
GEORGE: All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
JERRY: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
GEORGE: Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
JERRY: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
GEORGE: Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
JERRY: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
[New scene. Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.]
ELAINE: Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
(The phone rings, Farfel begins barking.)
ELAINE: Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
[Cut back to Jerry and George.]
GEORGE: I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
JERRY: I don't know what to do.
GEORGE: What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
JERRY: I know, I know.
GEORGE: So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
JERRY: It is kind of silly.
GEORGE: Of course it is.
JERRY: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
GEORGE: Exactly.
JERRY: It's not like she's *in* the movie.
GEORGE: Right.
JERRY: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
GEORGE: And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
JERRY: How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
GEORGE: Good.
JERRY: Saving movies.
GEORGE: Ridiculous!
JERRY: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
GEORGE: Oh, you're dead.
[New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. Farfel is barking as loud as ever.]
GAVIN: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!
JERRY: You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
GAVIN: Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first, first rate facility, top notch physicians.
KRAMER: Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
GAVIN: He won't hurt you, he's just playing.
KRAMER: Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
GAVIN: Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
ELLEN: Kramer, are you coming?
JERRY: Oh, hi Ellen.
ELLEN: Get in here.
(Kramer sulks off.)
JERRY: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
GAVIN: Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit him before the month is out.
JERRY: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
(Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's apartment.)
[New scene. Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment.]
ELAINE: We made plans.
JERRY: Why don't we just rent a movie?
ELAINE: I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
JERRY: No, it&Mac226s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
ELAINE: Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
JERRY: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
ELAINE: Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
JERRY: You and George got together?
ELAINE: Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
(Kramer enters.)
JERRY: Hello.
KRAMER: Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
JERRY: What's up?
KRAMER: Well, ah you were right.
JERRY: About what?
KRAMER: Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
JERRY and ELAINE, together: Awwwwww.
JERRY: Too bad.
ELAINE: I thought she was the one.
KRAMER: I'll bring back the pot.
ELAINE: Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
KRAMER: Hey, what are you gonna see?
JERRY: Prognosis Negative.
KRAMER: Hey, that's supposed to be great.
JERRY: It's not.
KRAMER: How do you know?
JERRY: I have an instinct for these things.
[Closing monologue; Comedy Club]
JERRY: I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
[OPENING MONOLOGUE]
JERRY: Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
[JERRY'S APARTMENT]
JERRY: Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
KRAMER: enters
JERRY: Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
KRAMER: What's the problem?
JERRY: This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
KRAMER: Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
JERRY: It doesn't work like that.
KRAMER: If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
JERRY: It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
FLASHBACK (to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress)
JERRY: That orange dress is burned in my memory
KRAMER: Oh, memory burn.
JERRY: I wonder what ever happened to her.
KRAMER: How did they ever find you?
JERRY: Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
(buzzer)
JERRY: It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
KRAMER: You know I never got a library card.
JERRY: (to speaker) Coming down.
KRAMER: It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
JERRY: I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
KRAMER: Yeah,
[LIBRARY]
KRAMER: The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
JERRY: Where's George
READER: Shhh.
KRAMER: Tryin' to save a quarter.
JERRY: I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
TURNING TO LIBRARY COUNTER
JERRY: This woman's completely ignoring me.
KRAMER: Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
JERRY: Eventually a little shot of penicillin
LIBRARIAN: Yes?
JERRY: Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
LIBRARIAN: Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.
KRAMER: Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
LIBRARIAN: It's true.
KRAMER: That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
LIBRARIAN: Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.
JERRY: Can I speak with this Bookman?
LIBRARIAN: Just a second.
(GEORGE ENTERS, FRANTICALLY, TUGS AT JERRY'S JACKET)
GEORGE: Jerry, Jerry
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: I think I saw him. I think it's him.
JERRY: Who?
GEORGE: Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: yeah
GEORGE: I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
READER: Shhh.
JERRY: (whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?
GEORGE: He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
JERRY: George got him fired. He squealed on him.
KRAMER: Ooh tattle tale
GEORGE: (yells) I didn't tattle
READER: Shh Shh
KRAMER: What did this guy do? What happened?
GEORGE: There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
KRAMER: Oh come on, You can tell me.
GEORGE: Some other time.
KRAMER: What tonight?
(LIBRARIAN WALKS BY)
KRAMER: Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
JERRY: Oh, he sang like a canary.
LIBRARIAN: Mr. Bookman's not here.
JERRY: Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
LIBRARIAN: He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
KRAMER: He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
JERRY: Well what am I supposed to do now?
LIBRARIAN: I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
JERRY: All right Thanks. Come on lets go
GEORGE: Let's see if it's Hayman?
KRAMER: Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
[PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES]
ELAINE: Where's Karen?
SECRETARY: She went to pick up lunch.
ELAINE: Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
SECRETARY: She must have forgot.
ELAINE: How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.
Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.
SECRETARY: I don't know anything.
ELAINE: Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
(LIPPMAN ENTERS)
ELAINE: Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
LIPPMAN: Elaine,
ELAINE: Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
LIPPMAN: Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.
ELAINE: Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
[AT MONKS]
ELAINE: I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
JERRY: So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
ELAINE: What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
GEORGE: I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
ELAINE: What did he do?
GEORGE: He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
JERRY: I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
GEORGE: OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
JERRY: I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
GEORGE: Little baked beans
JERRY: Echh
ELAINE: Come on tell me what happened.
GEORGE: Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
[FLASHBACK TO HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM]
GEORGE: ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
HEYMAN: Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja
GEORGE: Yes, Mr. Hayman
HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha ha, Well what brand?
GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...
HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.
(GEORGE gets a wedgie)
[BACK TO MONK'S]
GEORGE: He gave me a wedgie.
JERRY: He got fired the next day.
ELAINE: Why do they call it a wedgie?
GEORGE: Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
JERRY: They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
ELAINE: Boys are sick.
JERRY: Well what do girls do ?
ELAINE: We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
(KRAMER ENTERS)
GEORGE: I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226m the guy who ruined his life.
KRAMER: Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
[MIDDLE MONOLOGUE]
JERRY: What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
[JERRY'S APARTMENT]
JERRY: Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
BOOKMAN: You got any coffee?
JERRY: Coffee?
BOOKMAN: Yeah. Coffee.
JERRY: No, I don't drink coffee.
BOOKMAN: Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?
JERRY: No, I don't have--
BOOKMAN: You don't have any instant coffee?
JERRY: Well, I don't normally--
BOOKMAN: Who doesn't have instant coffee?
JERRY: I don't.
BOOKMAN: You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.
JERRY: Really? I'll have to remember that.
BOOKMAN: You took this book out in 1971.
JERRY: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
BOOKMAN: Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella.
JERRY: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
BOOKMAN: You're a comedian, you make people laugh.
JERRY: I try.
BOOKMAN: You think this is all a big joke, don't you?
JERRY: No, I don't.
BOOKMAN: I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?
JERRY: Certainly not.
BOOKMAN: Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!
(Marion sneaks into Kramer's apartment behind Bookman's back as he opens Jerry's door to leave)
[KRAMER'S APARTMENT]
KRAMER: What's wrong?
MARION: It's Bookman the library cop.
KRAMER: So I, I didn't do anything wrong.
MARION: I'm supposed to be at work. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.
KRAMER: Why don't ya' leave?
MARION: I can't.
(JERRY'S DOORWAY)
JERRY: No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
[IN MONKS WITH SHERRY]
SHERRY: Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.
JERRY: So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
SHERRY: I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.
JERRY: Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
SHERRY: Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?
JERRY: No Black Jack?
SHERRY: Uch! Licorice gum? Never! We were ah, reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,
JERRY: Tropic of Cancer.
SHERRY: No, Tropic of Capricorn
JERRY: Tropic of Capricorn?
SHERRY: Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... "As I have learned from bitter experience is sexual intercourse ."
JERRY: Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
We read from TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. I was all set to return TROPIC OF CANCER. And then ...
[FLASHBACK TO LOCKER ROOM]
JERRY: George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
JERRY: Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
[BACK TO MONKS]
SHERRY: Where ya' going?
JERRY: It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
[LIBRARY]
KRAMER: Read another poem.
MARION: Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.
KRAMER: Wow, that is great. You should be published.
KRAMER: You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
MARIAN: Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO!
KRAMER: HELLO!
MARIAN: HELLO!
KRAMER: HELLO!
MARIAN: HELLO!
BOOKMAN (emerging): Hello!
MARIAN (turning, surprised): Mr. Bookman.
BOOKMAN: I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly, discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life. We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?
[JERRY'S APARTMENT]
(Jerry in bedroom)
ELAINE: Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
JERRY: Maybe you're getting' a raise.
(buzzer)
ELAINE: Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: It's George
ELAINE: George is on his way up.
JERRY: Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
KRAMER: (reading) sobs
ELAINE: Are you OK? What? What?
KRAMER: It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
ELAINE: Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
(Jerry enters).
JERRY: I'm right here.
ELAINE: Remember that Columbus book?
JERRY: Columbus, Euro trash.
(George enters)
GEORGE: Well, it's definetly him.
ELAINE: Him? Him who?
GEORGE: Him who? Hayman him.
ELAINE: Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
GEORGE: Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
JERRY: That was double overtime.
GEORGE: So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
ELAINE: At least it wasn't atomic.
GEORGE: It was.
JERRY: So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
GEORGE: How should I know?
JERRY: Because I gave it to you.
GEORGE: Me?
JERRY: Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
GEORGE: The locker room!
[THE LOCKER ROOM]
JERRY: Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
JERRY: All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
HEYMAN: Can't Stand Ya'.
GEORGE: Yes Mr. Hayman.
HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.
GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?
GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...
HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.
(George gets a wedgie and TROPIC OF CANCER falls on floor)
GEORGE: (shouting) No No No!
[LIBRARY]
( Jerry writes out a check for the never-returned TROPIC OF CANCER and hands it to Bookman)
JERRY: Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
BOOKMAN: Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?
JERRY: What is your problem?
BOOKMAN: What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a pitbull on a poodle.
JERRY: (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
ELAINE: Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
JERRY: Oh, beautiful did he like them?
ELAINE: No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
JERRY: (to George) Was he out there?
GEORGE: Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
JERRY: I guess we'll never know.
[SOME BACK ALLEY]
HEYMAN: Can't stand ya, (laughing) Can't stand ya. (pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground)
[CLOSING MONOLOGUE]
JERRY: Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
[ACT ONE SCENE A INT. ESCALATOR - GOING DOWN TO A GARAGE. IN SINGLE FILE: GEORGE, JERRY AND ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.]
GEORGE: One left...what a joke.
KRAMER: You can have this one.
GEORGE: No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
ELAINE: Hey, I didn't get one either.
JERRY: Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
ELAINE: This is what people do.
JERRY: No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
(THEY GET OFF THE ESCALATOR AND HEAD FOR THE CAR.)
[ACT ONE SCENE B INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS JERRY, GEORGE, ELAINE AND KRAMER.]
GEORGE: You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
ELAINE: So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
GEORGE: Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
JERRY: Big accomplishment.
GEORGE: Fish. What do they do?
ELAINE: What do you do?
KRAMER: It's this way.
GEORGE: What time is it?
JERRY: Five o'clock.
GEORGE: Always late. Always late.
JERRY: You're not late.
GEORGE: I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
ELAINE: Who?
GEORGE: My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
JERRY: Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
ELAINE: Isn't it going the other way?
JERRY: There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
ELAINE: But it's Saturday.
JERRY: You got the picnic and burger traffic.
GEORGE: I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
(KRAMER STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND.)
ELAINE: What's the matter?
(HE MUMBLES SOMETHING AND CONTINUES WALKING.)
JERRY: I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
(KRAMER STUMBLES WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER.)
JERRY: (CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
KRAMER: No, no, I got it.
(AND HE STUMBLES AGAIN. JERRY SPOTS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.)
JERRY: (TO GEORGE, RE:WOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
GEORGE: Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
KRAMER: If you like her, go talk to her.
GEORGE: Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
KRAMER: She's fat.
ELAINE: Oh she's fat?
KRAMER STOPS AGAIN, CONFUSED.
ELAINE: What? JERRY Where's the car?
KRAMER: I thought it was here.
GEORGE: You don't know where we parked?
(KRAMER LOOKS AROUND, THEN RESUMES WALKING. THEY FOLLOW.)
GEORGE: Oh, this is great.
KRAMER: Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
JERRY: I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
ELAINE: I didn't pay attention.
GEORGE: This is just what I need.
ELAINE: I'm sure it's right around here.
KRAMER: It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
GEORGE: There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
JERRY: It's over there. I know where it is.
(NOW JERRY TAKES THE LEAD AND THE OTHERS FOLLOW.)
ELAINE: It's black, right?
KRAMER: Dark blue.
GEORGE: (MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
JERRY: There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
THEY STOP...
JERRY: (CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
KRAMER: Didn't we come in over there?
JERRY: I thought it was over there.
(FROM THERE P.O.V. THE CAMERA DOES A THREE SIXTY AND WE GET A SENSE OF HOW ENORMOUS THIS PLACE IS, THEN)
ELAINE: How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
KRAMER: About two hours.
ELAINE: (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
GEORGE: It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF:
GEORGE & ELAINE WITH KRAMER & JERRY BEHIND THEM.
JERRY: I really have to go to the bathroom.
KRAMER: Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
ERRY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.
KRAMER: (CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.
JERRY: I'll wait.
KRAMER: You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
JERRY: Alright.
KRAMER: Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
JERRY: Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
(ANGLE ON ELAINE AND GEORGE...)
ELAINE: (RE: CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
(A CAR SCREECHES AROUND A CURVE, ELAINE IS UNNERVED.)
ELAINE: (CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
GEORGE: ...Six wrong?
ELAINE: Those school zones are a killer.
JERRY: (TO KRAMER, RE:BOX) Will you let me help you with that?
KRAMER: I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
HE DOES SO.
JERRY: You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
KRAMER: (TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
GEORGE: Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
ELAINE: (LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
KRAMER: Look at this place. It's huge...
GEORGE: I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
JERRY: Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
GEORGE: Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
KRAMER: It's got to be here.
ELAINE: Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
JERRY: Maybe it's not on this level.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
ELAINE: It felt like a couple of levels.
JERRY: You should always carry a pad and pen.
GEORGE: I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
KRAMER: I have a pen.
THEY REACT...
JERRY: Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
MOTHER: (O.C.) Don't you dare talk to me like that! You hear me?
ELAINE: Look at that woman.
SHE'S HITTING HER BOY ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.
MOTHER: I told you! I don't care! You'll have to wait.
GEORGE: (TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?
MOTHER: (TO GEORGE) Why don't you mind your own business?
GEORGE: I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
KID: (TO GEORGE) You're ugly.
GEORGE: ...What?
KID: You're ugly.
GEORGE: You are!
KID: You are!
(THE KID GETS IN THE CAR. GEORGE IS STUNNED.)
GEORGE: I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
KRAMER: (RE: CAR) I found it!
ELAINE: He's got it.
KRAMER: Oh...no.
JERRY: All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
ELAINE: Jerry, look at my fish.
(JERRY HOLDS UP THE BAG AND HITS IT WITH HIS FINGER.)
JERRY: His eyes look a little cloudy.
GEORGE: Oh are they gonna be furious.
JERRY: Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
KRAMER: It was easy the last time.
ELAINE: My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
JERRY: No one's going to do that.
(ELAINE SPOTS A FORTY-ISH, STYLISH COUPLE WALKING TO THEIR CAR.)
ELAINE: Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
MAN #1: (HOLDING HIS HANDS UP) ...Sorry.
ELAINE: Five minutes.
MAN #1: Can't do it.
ELAINE: We're not wilding.
THEY LEAVE.
(SHE APPROACHES TWO GIRLS - EARLY TWENTIES, MALL KIDS.)
ELAINE: (CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
(THEY START LAUGHING.)
ELAINE: (CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
(THEY IGNORE HER AND KEEP LAUGHING. CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.)
JERRY: Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
KRAMER: Right here at the mall.
(BACK TO ELAINE, SEEKING OUT A MAN WITH A BEARD.)
ELAINE: Excuse me...
(HE IGNORES HER AND KEEPS WALKING.)
ELAINE: (CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
(CUT TO JERRY AND KRAMER.)
JERRY: It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
KRAMER: You drank a whole bottle of water.
JERRY: I know.
KRAMER: So why don't you just go?
JERRY: No I can't.
KRAMER: Don't you get tired of following rules?
JERRY: You think I'm too cautious?
KRAMER: Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
JERRY: Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
KRAMER: Buddy Hackett?
JERRY: He's a comedian.
KRAMER: I know.
JERRY: All right. All right.
KRAMER: (pointing) You can go over here.
JERRY: I can manage.
KRAMER: (turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
KRAMER: It'll take you ten seconds.
HE NUDGES JERRY.
JERRY: Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
(WE STAY WITH JERRY AS HE WALKS TO THE BACK OF A CAR, LOOKS AROUND LIKE SUPERMAN, THEN LETS FLY. HE FINISHES, ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS AND SEES A SECURITY GUARD STARING AT HIM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED.)
SECURITY GUARD: Okay, let's go. Come with me.
JERRY: But...
SECURITY GUARD: Come on.
JERRY: (STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer
(END OF ACT ONE)
[ACT TWO SCENE C INT. SECURITY GUARD'S OFFICE - A SMALL ROOM WITH A DESK AND A CHAIR. JERRY PLEADS FOR HIS RELEASE.]
JERRY: I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
SECURITY GUARD: Well you're still not allowed.
JERRY: Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
SECURITY GUARD: That's up to you.
JERRY: So you don't care if I die.
SECURITY GUARD: What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.
JERRY: It was life and death.
SECURITY GUARD: Uh huh.
JERRY: Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
SECURITY GUARD: I don't know.
JERRY: Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
JERRY: (C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
SECURITY GUARD: You can tell the police all about it.
[ACT TWO SCENE D INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE, KRAMER, AND ELAINE.]
KRAMER: (CALLING OUT) Jerry!
ELAINE: Jerry!
GEORGE: Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
ELAINE: Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
GEORGE: Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
GEORGE: If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
ELAINE: No, no, I'll be back.
(SHE LEAVES.)
GEORGE: Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
KRAMER: Does that bother you?
GEORGE: Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
KRAMER: Not at all.
GEORGE: See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
KRAMER: I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
[ACT TWO SCENE E INT. SECURITY OFFICE - JERRY AND THE SECURITY GUARD.]
JERRY: First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
SECURITY GUARD: I know what you did.
JERRY: Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
JERRY: (CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
SECURITY GUARD: Yeah I'm sure.
JERRY: You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
[ACT TWO SCENE F INT. PARKING GARAGE - ELAINE, LOOKING FOR JERRY. SHE'S TALKING TO AN OLDER BLACK MAN ABOUT TO GET IN HIS CAR.]
ELAINE: And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
MAN #1: I can't do it.
ELAINE: But why? Why can't you do it?
MAN #1: I can't.
ELAINE: No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
MAN #1: That's right.
ELAINE: But why? Why don't you want to?
MAN #1: I don't know.
ELAINE: But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
MAN #:1 No, I wouldn't.
[ACT TWO SCENE G INT. SECURITY SHACK]
JERRY: (A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
JERRY: (CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
[ACT TWO SCENE H INT. PARKING GARAGE - GEORGE AND KRAMER, STILL LOOKING FOR THE CAR.]
KRAMER: The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
GEORGE: (NOT INTERESTED) Really.
KRAMER: What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
GEORGE: Who's Killer Kowalski?
KRAMER: He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
GEORGE: I've gotta go to the bathroom.
KRAMER: So go. GEORGE Here?
KRAMER: (SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.
(GEORGE WALKS OUT OF THE FRAME AS KRAMER CONTINUES TO SCAN THE GARAGE. CUT TO GEORGE FINISHING UP. HE ZIPS UP, THEN TURNS, STARTLED. CUT TO THE SAME SECURITY GUARD, ARMS FOLDED, STARING AT HIM.)
[ACT TWO SCENE J INT. SECURITY OFFICE - GEORGE BEING LED IN BY THE SECURITY GUARD.]
GEORGE: Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
SECURITY GUARD: Oh your folks have an anniversary today too?
JERRY: (TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
GEORGE: (TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
[ACT TWO SCENE K INT. PARKING GARAGE - KRAMER, WANDERING AIMLESSLY.]
KRAMER: George! George!
[ACT TWO SCENE L INT. PARKING GARAGE]
ELAINE: Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)
[ACT TWO SCENE M INT. PARKING GARAGE - JERRY AND GEORGE ARE BACK IN THE GARAGE EACH HOLDING THEIR SUMMONS.]
JERRY: Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
JERRY: Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
ELAINE: (O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
ELAINE: (O.C.) Jerry! Over here...
(NOW THEY SPOT HER.)
ELAINE: (CONT'D) Where have you been?
JERRY: I was arrested for urinating.
GEORGE: (PROUDLY) Me too.
ELAINE: You what?
JERRY: I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
ELAINE: Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
JERRY: No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
ELAINE: (DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
MAN #2: Can't do it.
ELAINE: I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
MAN #3: Sorry. (THEY KEEP WALKING.)
ELAINE: That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
(THEY LOOK BACK AT HER.)
ELAINE: (CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
GEORGE: Elaine, shut-up.
JERRY: Hey, where's Kramer?
GEORGE: I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
ELAINE: I thought he was with you.
GEORGE: See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
(HE LOOKS AT JERRY'S WATCH AND THROWS HIS HANDS UP.)
GEORGE: (CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.
ELAINE: Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
GEORGE: We came in over there!
ELAINE: We didn't come in over there!
JERRY: Where's Kramer?
(JERRY SEES THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN THEY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, AMY.)
JERRY: Hey George, there she is again. ...
GEORGE: So what do you want me to do?
JERRY: Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
GEORGE: That is an opening.
(GEORGE TENTATIVELY APPROACHES HER...)
GEORGE: (CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
AMY: Oh sure, I'll drive you around.
GEORGE: You will?
AMY: Sure.
(GEORGE WAVES FOR JERRY AND ELAINE.)
GEORGE: Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
AMY: I wouldn't want to get lost in here. It smells like a toilet. People are such animals.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Filthy pigs.
(THEY ALL GET IN THE CAR.)
GEORGE: It's a blue Honda...
AMY: This has happened to me too. It's very frustrating.
ELAINE: Hi, I'm Elaine.
JERRY: Jerry.
AMY: Hello.
ELAINE: It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
AMY: I'm happy to do it. (TO GEORGE) I'm Amy.
GEORGE: Hi Amy, I'm George.
(GEORGE TURNS TO THE BACK SEAT AND GIVES AND GIVE A, "HOW BOUT THIS?" LOOK.)
[ACT TWO SCENE N INT. PARKING GARAGE - MINUTES LATER LONG SHOT OF CAR - THE BRAKES SQUEAL AND THE CAR COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP, THEN GEORGE, ELAINE, AND JERRY GET OUT.]
GEORGE: (TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
(SHE PULLS OUT, LEAVING RUBBER, THEN)
GEORGE: (CONT'D) ...with that group.
ELAINE: (SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
JERRY: Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
ELAINE: I'll say.
(THEY TURN TO GEORGE, WHO'S GAPING AT SOMETHING.)
ELAINE: What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
JERRY: The car!
GEORGE: The car!
ELAINE: We found it. I can't believe it!
THEY WALK TO IT...SUDDENLY GEORGE STOPS.
GEORGE: Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
JERRY: Kramer!
(THEY ALL SLUMP AGAINST THE CAR. ELAINE HOLDS UP HER FISH)
[ACT TWO SCENE P INT. PARKING GARAGE - ONE HOUR LATER SAME SHOT - BUT NO FISH. IN THE DISTANCE WE CAN MAKE OUT KRAMER STRUGGLING WITH THE AIR-CONDITIONER. JERRY TAPS ELAINE WITH HIS ELBOW. ELAINE TAPS GEORGE. WE STAY ON KRAMER AS HE GETS CLOSER.]
JERRY: Kramer.
KRAMER: Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah, over here.
KRAMER: Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
GEORGE: Purple 23.
KRAMER: Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
GEORGE: Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
(THEY GET IN THE CAR.)
KRAMER: What time is it?
GEORGE: Seven forty-five.
KRAMER: Well at least there's no traffic.
GEORGE: Right.
KRAMER: What time does that play start?
GEORGE: Eight o'clock.
KRAMER: That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
(JERRY INDICATES HE SHOULDN'T PURSUE THAT.)
KRAMER: (CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
SILENCE. HE STARTS UP THE CAR AND AS THEY HEAD OUT... FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO
[Opening monologue.]
You know there's like always one, location in your neighborhood, one store location that's constantly, changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, then it's a yogurt shop, then it's a pet supply. It's like constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in the mother ship from Close Encounters, the bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out, in a daze going ?I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you??
[George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says Grand opening.]
GEORGE: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't nice.
JERRY: This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
GEORGE: Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
JERRY: What's that smell? What are you wearing?
GEORGE: What, a 'little' cologne.
JERRY: Manly.
GEORGE: Monica wants me to wear it.
JERRY: So why didn't you say no?
GEORGE: I'm too nice.
JERRY: Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
GEORGE: She wants me to take an IQ test.
JERRY: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
GEORGE: No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
JERRY: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
GEORGE: You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
GEORGE: Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
JERRY: Who thinks you're smart?
GEORGE: I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
JERRY: What thing?
GEORGE: You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
JERRY: Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
GEORGE: I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
JERRY: What'd ya get?
GEORGE: What did I get or what do I say I got?
JERRY: What do you say?
GEORGE: I say fourteen o nine (1409).
JERRY: 1409, that's a good score.
GEORGE: Psst, You're telling me.
JERRY: What did you really get?
GEORGE: You are my friend.
JERRY: Of course.
GEORGE: I tell you everything, right?
JERRY: I hope so.
GEORGE: Well, this I take to the grave.
[Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars and Elaine is reading a newspaper.]
JERRY: He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
ELAINE: Why do you keep watching?
JERRY: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for  survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for  him for a second.
ELAINE: And then you flush.
JERRY: Well, it's a spider.
ELAINE: You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
(Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.)
ELAINE: Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
JERRY: Bazooka Joe.
(Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at and motions with his arm to Elaine who is closer to the door.)
JERRY: The buzzer.
ELAINE: It's your house.
JERRY: My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
INTERCOM: It's George.
JERRY: Come on up.
ELAINE: Casus belli.
JERRY: What's that?
ELAINE: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
JERRY: Come on, Go in, go in!  [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
ELAINE: Have you gone in there?
JERRY: No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
(George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.)
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
(Elaine sniffs around George.)
GEORGE: I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
ELAINE: Sure, fine.
JERRY: Casus belli.
ELAINE: Casus belli.
GEORGE: What's that?
ELAINE: Since when do you wear cologne?
GEORGE: Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
JERRY: Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
GEORGE: I didn't take it, yet.
(Elaine opens up the newspaper and starts leafing through it, reading some articles while still maintaining her part of the conversation)
ELAINE: What IQ test?
GEORGE: What's casus belli.
JERRY: Oh, it's nothing...
GEORGE: Is it about me?
JERRY: Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
ELAINE: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
JERRY: This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like fun.
GEORGE: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
ELAINE: You'll do well, you're smart.
JERRY: No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
ELAINE: Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
GEORGE: It varies.
JERRY: You know, I don't even know my IQ.
ELAINE: huh, Mine's 145.
GEORGE: 145!
JERRY: Get out of here!
ELAINE: You get out of here!
JERRY: You get out of here!
ELAINE: Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
GEORGE: Shst, You should take the test for me.
ELAINE: Huh.
JERRY: Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
GEORGE: Haha (laughs)
JERRY: Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.  (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
(Jerry tosses something to Elaine and she catches it)
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
ELAINE: Are you serious?
GEORGE: Why not?
ELAINE: Where would I take the test?
GEORGE: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
ELAINE: No, that'd be too noisy.
JERRY: Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
ELAINE: Hey, what do you think?
JERRY: Hey, I love a good caper.
ELAINE: Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
GEORGE: You'll do it?
ELAINE: What the hey.
GEORGE: Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
[Dream Cafe. Babu anxiously looking out the window. Jerry comes in.]
Babu Bhatt: Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
JERRY: Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
BABU: Oh, ah how did you hear about us?
JERRY: Eh, people, people are talking.
BABU: Smoking or non-smoking? We are proud to offer both.
JERRY: Ah, non-smoking would be great.
BABU: Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot folded face cloth for your pleasure.
JERRY: Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
BABU: Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.
JERRY: Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
BABU: Oh, the turkey.
JERRY: Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
BABU: You're very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...
JERRY: (thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
[George is taking a test in Monica's bedroom.]
GEORGE: You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
MONICA: But why?
GEORGE: I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
MONICA: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.
GEORGE: Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
MONICA: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.
GEORGE: Well, I think you're wrong about that.  [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
MONICA: Good luck.
GEORGE: Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
(Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is waiting outside.)
ELAINE: What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
GEORGE: I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
ELAINE: All right, what time do you want me back here.
GEORGE: Ah, ah, twenty to three.
ELAINE: Ok.
GEORGE: Thanks again.
ELAINE: All right.
GEORGE: A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
(George gives Elaine the thumbs up, closes the window and then gives her the OK sign.)
[Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for Jerry.]
JERRY: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
BABU: It is in deed my pleasure.
JERRY: Oh, please...
(Elaine comes in carrying the envelope with the IQ test and a pencil in her mouth.)
BABU: Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. (runs to get a menu.) Our specials today...
ELAINE: Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
BABU: Tea and toast.
JERRY: Eat something! Babu...
ELAINE: Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
BABU: Oh, oh very good choice. Very good.
(Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.)
JERRY: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
ELAINE: I know.
(Kramer comes in.)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Oh boy. Woop...
(Kramer sitting down at the table next to Elaine - he sits a bit too hard and shakes the table -- silverware and plates rattle ... mustard bottle teetering - thus startling Elaine, who stops the test for a moment, but gets right back to it.)
KRAMER: Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...  (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
ELAINE: Hey.
KRAMER: This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
JERRY: So?
KRAMER: Well, I'm not giving it back.
JERRY: Why not?
KRAMER: Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
(Kramer takes some nachos and spills some of them on the IQ test.)
KRAMER: Oh, gees...
ELAINE: Ok,
KRAMER: You're all right
ELAINE: Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
KRAMER: (eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
JERRY: Statute.
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
KRAMER: No, it's statue.
JERRY: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
KRAMER: Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
ELAINE: Statute.
KRAMER: Oh, I really think you're wrong.
ELAINE: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
KRAMER: What test?
ELAINE: An IQ test.
KRAMER: Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?
ELAINE: It's for George.
KRAMER: George?
ELAINE: Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
KRAMER: Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
ELAINE: Would you please?!
KRAMER: What, is it for a job or something?
ELAINE: Later!
KRAMER: You're positive it's statute?
ELAINE: Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
BABU: Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face towel for your... (gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams, Elaine screams and Kramer falls from his chair.  He gets up and is dazed)
[Monica's. George is reading a New Yorker on the bed and Monica is trying to get in. The door is locked.]
MONICA: George?
GEORGE: Yeah?
MONICA: The door is locked.
GEORGE: Oh, it's locked?
MONICA: I need to get something.
GEORGE: Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
MONICA: George!
GEORGE: Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
[Dream Cafe. Babu is cleaning and singing -- Jerry is seemingly enjoying Babu's singing as Elaine gets distracted from the IQ test.]
BABU: Nananeena, Ladadeeda, laadadeeda, saadina.... Laadadeeda sa saadina (singing too loud)
ELAINE: Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
BABU: Set. ok
ELAINE: Set.
BABU: I'll get it ...
(Babu comes to collect dishes from Elaine's table and knocks down a cup of coffee.)
ELAINE: Oh my God! It's all over the test!
BABU: Oh, I did sc-I'm terribly sorry.
JERRY: Oh my God.
ELAINE: Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
BABU: Please, forgive me, please...
JERRY: Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
ELAINE: Uhh.
BABU: (opens the door for Elaine) Please, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!
(Babu sits down at the table and Jerry sits down across from him)
JERRY: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
BABU: You're a very kind man.
JERRY: Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
BABU: Yes, Pakistani, yes.
JERRY: Babu, may I say something?
BABU: Of course, you're very smart man, I listen.
JERRY: I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
BABU: But there are no Pakistani people here.
JERRY: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
BABU: Yes, you see everything, don't you?
JERRY: Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
BABU: I close down today and when I open again it'll be all Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you so much, you're very special person, very special.
(Babu leaves)
JERRY (thinking) I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?
[Elaine is giving the test back to George.]
ELAINE: It was an accident.
GEORGE: What did you go on a picnic?
ELAINE: Babu Bhatt did it.
GEORGE: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
MONICA: Time's up George.
GEORGE: U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
MONICA: How did you do?
GEORGE: Piece of cake; hu.
MONICA: What happened to the test?
GEORGE: What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
MONICA: Food? What food?
GEORGE: What are you talking about?
MONICA: Where did you get food?
GEORGE: From my pocket.
MONICA: Your pocket?
GEORGE: I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
MONICA: And coffee?
GEORGE: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
MONICA: Where did you get the coffee?
GEORGE: Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
MONICA: How did you get there?
GEORGE: I walked.
MONICA: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.
GEORGE: I climbed out the window.
MONICA: You climbed out the window?
GEORGE: Of course.
MONICA: Why didn't you go out the door?
GEORGE: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
MONICA: You're a fascinating man, George Costanza.
(George spreads his arms wide, elbows slightly bent -- his head bobbles a little bit.)
[Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is looking Dream cafe with binoculars. There's a sign on the window: Closed for renovation.]
JERRY: The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
ELAINE: You're very special.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
JERRY: Of course, I always do.
KRAMER: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
ELAINE: Just give it back to him.
KRAMER: Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)
(Jerry sees George from the window.)
JERRY: Hey Georgie!
GEORGE: Coming up.
JERRY: How'd you do on the IQ test?!
GEORGE: 85!
JERRY: What?!!
GEORGE: 85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
(Jerry laughs, pounding the window sill 3 times with his open palm.)
ELAINE: 85?
JERRY: Well, well, well...
ELAINE: He's coming up?
JERRY: Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
ELAINE: Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.
JERRY: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
(George comes in looking angry.)
GEORGE: Oh, hello Professor.
ELAINE: George, I cannot believe...
GEORGE: Please...
ELAINE: No there has got be a mistake.
GEORGE: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
JERRY: But an 85?
ELAINE: Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
JERRY (mocking) It was a madhouse.
ELAINE: Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
GEORGE: Ooh ho hoo, forget it.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
GEORGE: You could do worse!
ELAINE: No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
GEORGE: All right, I'll ask her.
ELAINE: Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
JERRY: Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
[Dream Cafe. Babu is at the window looking gloomy. Jerry comes in.]
JERRY: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
BABU: You see how I listen. I work very hard, borrow more money.
JERRY: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
BABU: You wish to eat?
JERRY: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
BABU: Very good.
JERRY (thinking) Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great.
[Jerry's apartment. Elaine is finishing the test.]
[Monica's bedroom. George is pacing the room.]
[Jerry's monologue.]
You know the IQ test, an they always have that sample question at the beginning where they show you how to fill in the circle. This should be the first elimination point right there. Anybody goes outside that circle,... ?Yeah, you wanna come with us please.   Yeah, yeah you're done, your test is over, you went outside the circle ok??
[Jerry's apartment. Elaine finishes the test, slaps down the pencil and stuffs the test back in the envelope.  She checks her watch for the time, stretches her arms above her head.]
ELAINE: (stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.
(Kramer charges in and locks the door behind him.)
ELAINE: What are you doing?
KRAMER: Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
ELAINE: What's going on?
MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Hey, Kramer! I saw you go there! I'm not leaving until you gimme that jacket. (Bangs on the door) Open up Kramer!
ELAINE: Wha'd you come in here for?
KRAMER: Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
(3 more Bangs on the door)
ELAINE: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
KRAMER: I thought you took the test.
ELAINE: I had to take it again.
KRAMER: How come?
ELAINE: What's the difference?!!
(3 more Bangs on the door)
KRAMER: Well, you can't leave now.
ELAINE: What?
MAN BEHIND THE DOOR: Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!
KRAMER: Never!
(4 more Bangs on the door)
[Monica's apartment. George is looking out the window.  3 light knocks on the bedroom door]
MONICA: Come on George, open up.
(George anxious and quietly frustrated -- he reluctantly opens the door.)
MONICA: Well?
(George shakes her hand and clasping his left hand over hers -- creating a hand sandwich.)
GEORGE: How' you doing?
MONICA: Where's the test?
GEORGE: Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
[Dream Cafe. Babu is looking at Jerry as he eats.]
JERRY: Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
BABU: The shrimp is stringy?
JERRY: Well, maybe your refrigerator...
BABU: Quiet!!
JERRY: No I...
BABU: You shut up!
JERRY: Well I...
BABU: You make me change restaurant, but nobody come! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!
JERRY: You know, I think I'll just take the check.
BABU: You bad man! You very very bad man! [leaves]
JERRY: (thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
[Monica's. Elaine is gently tapping on the bedroom window. Monica comes to open it.]
MONICA: Are you looking for George?
ELAINE: Well eh, kind of....
MONICA: George left.
ELAINE: Oh.
MONICA: Is, that the test?
ELAINE: Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
MONICA: Thanks. I hope you do a lot better this time.
ELAINE: Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
[At the street. Dream Cafe has a Closed sign on the window and men are carrying furniture out.]
[George, Jerry and Kramer are standing across the street. Kramer has no jacket on.]
JERRY: You know what it was, bad location.
GEORGE: Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
JERRY: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
KRAMER: h-Yeah...
JERRY: Oh, sorry.
KRAMER: I'm going upstairs.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Hey guys...
JERRY: Hey.
ELAINE: I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
JERRY: 151?
ELAINE: Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)
GEORGE: That's a good score.
JERRY: So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
GEORGE: Italian.
ELAINE: No, Chinese.
JERRY: You know, what would be great?
(George and Elaine give Jerry a long look.)
[Closing monologue.]
It's tough to do a good deed. Let's look at your professional good deed doers. Your Lone Rangers, your Superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They're all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, yeah, thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm rentin' here, They got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?"
[Opening monologue]
JERRY: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
[Jerry's apartment]
(A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry doing work with headphones on.)
REPAIRMAN: .....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.
JERRY: Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
REPAIRMAN: So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration
JERRY: Oh! well whatever you have to do.
REPAIRMAN: I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.
JERRY: (sarcastically) No you don't..
(George enters the apartment.)
GEORGE: Hey! what are listening to?
JERRY: My show from last night.
GEORGE: Oh! you taped it?
JERRY: Yeah , I was doing new material.
GEORGE: Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
JERRY: Huh?
GEORGE: Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
JERRY: The" coup dé-toe"
GEORGE: Yeah. Did you do it?
JERRY: Yeah!
GEORGE: So?
JERRY: Nothin'.....nothing at all.
GEORGE: Need to use the phone.
JERRY: Who you calling?
GEORGE: China.
JERRY: China really?
GEORGE: Yeah. I'll pay for it.
JERRY: What for?
GEORGE: What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
JERRY: Hair?
GEORGE: The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
JERRY: Done what?
GEORGE: Discovered a cure for baldness.
REPAIRMAN: Did you see that last night?
GEORGE: It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
JERRY: (to Kramer) What's this?
KRAMER: Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
GEORGE: Is that the guy who likes fat women?
JERRY: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
KRAMER: (to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
GEORGE: I did, I'm trying to call China.
KRAMER: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
JERRY: Oh! my God!....
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
GEORGE: (George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
KRAMER: Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
GEORGE: Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?
JERRY: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
GEORGE: This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
KRAMER: All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
GEORGE: WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
JERRY: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
GEORGE: My god!!!
KRAMER: C'mon it's my turn.
GEORGE: All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
JERRY: Good question.
KRAMER: Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!
[Cut to Monks]
GEORGE: What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
JERRY: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
ELAINE: Hi boys.
BOTH: Hello...
ELAINE: What's happening?
JERRY: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
GEORGE: This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
JERRY: (pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!

JERRY: The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
GEORGE: I thought you meant the..
JERRY: No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
ELAINE: What did she say?
PETER: Seinfeld.....( from way in the back of the restaurant. Cheesy plot device to have Jerry leave the table for a minute so George and Elaine can talk)
JERRY: Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
ELAINE: So did you hear this message?
GEORGE: Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
ELAINE: Really!
GEORGE: Yeah. I can't get over it.
ELAINE: Huh! Sexy?
GEORGE: This woman drove us out of our minds
ELAINE: Like ...humm...How did she sound?
GEORGE: She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
ELAINE: Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
GEORGE: Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....

GEORGE: Oh! no no nothing....
ELAINE: Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
GEORGE: I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
ELAINE: Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
GEORGE: Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
(Jerry comes back)
JERRY: Remember Peter?
GEORGE: Peter?
JERRY: You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
ELAINE: So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
JERRY: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
ELAINE: I don't know.
JERRY: She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
ELAINE: Oh! really.
JERRY: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
ELAINE: So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
JERRY: No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
ELAINE: Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
GEORGE: Wh.. Where you going?
ELAINE: Home.
GEORGE: Why you going home for?
ELAINE: Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
JERRY: Sure.
[Back to Jerry's]
GEORGE: Oh! my god. Oh! man...
JERRY: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
ELAINE: (coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
GEORGE: (phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?
JERRY: Why are you doing this?
GEORGE: Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.
JERRY: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
ELAINE: No.
JERRY: You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
GEORGE: Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
ELAINE: ( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.

ELAINE: Aah! Okaaay.
KRAMER: Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"

KRAMER: I'm doin' fine.

KRAMER: Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
JERRY: Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
GEORGE: English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
KRAMER: So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
GEORGE: In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
(Door buzzer rings)
KRAMER: That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
GEORGE: (visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.
KRAMER: So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
ELAINE: Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
GEORGE: All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
KRAMER: (to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
PING: $15.90.
KRAMER: $15.90.?
GEORGE: Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
PING: Chinese....Yeah.
GEORGE: Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.

(George leaves all excited.)
PING: (continues his phone call) Ha Pachini fair pousher pousher mouist I fai chin fousher...
JERRY: (as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
[On a street at night in George's car]

GEORGE: Yoohoo ,Plenty......Wh..wh..what are doing hum...you're going in?
ELAINE: Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?

ELAINE: Do you think of anything?..
GEORGE: No, no....(mumbles)
ELAINE: I am up for anything.
GEORGE: Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
ELAINE: I was just kiddin, around.......
GEORGE: I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
ELAINE: ( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
GEORGE: So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
ELAINE: Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.
(Elaine gets out of the car , George tries to catch his breath.)
[Back to Jerry's.]
JERRY: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
KRAMER: What is that?
JERRY: That's my cockney accent.
KRAMER: Naw ,na , that's no good.
JERRY: Lets hear yours.
KRAMER: Not bloody likely..
JERRY: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
GEORGE: Guess, what I got.
JERRY: Oh! Is that the bald stuff?
GEORGE: From China. All the way from China.
KRAMER: Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.
GEORGE: No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
JERRY: Yes I am skeptical.
GEORGE: Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
KRAMER: W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
JERRY: Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
GEORGE: All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
KRAMER: He's a happy camper huh?
JERRY: Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
KRAMER: Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
JERRY: No kidding?
KRAMER: He's in jail.
JERRY: What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
KRAMER: That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
JERRY: You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
KRAMER: It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
JERRY: How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
GEORGE: All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
JERRY: Hello.
ELAINE: It's Elaine Marie Benes.
JERRY: Well Hello..
ELAINE: Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
JERRY: Yes , I got her number.
GEORGE: Is that Elaine?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: HI ELAINE...
ELAINE: I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
JERRY: Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
ELAINE: Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
GEORGE: Did she say Hello?
JERRY: What? I dunno.
GEORGE: I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
JERRY: I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
GEORGE: Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
JERRY: She's coming up.
GEORGE: Elaine's coming up?
JERRY: Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
KRAMER: How often do you cut your toe nails?
JERRY: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
KRAMER: 'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
JERRY: The big toe; The captain.
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
ELAINE: Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
JERRY: Okay....too bad.
ELAINE: So humm....When you gonna call her?
JERRY: Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
ELAINE: Good luck.
JERRY: okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
GEORGE: Yeah, that was enough.
JERRY: That's it, you gave up?
GEORGE: No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
JERRY: That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
(As Jerry dials the girls number, George races to the bathroom one more time.)
ALICIA: Hello.
JERRY: Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
ALICIA: Yeah.
JERRY: This is Jerry Seinfeld.
[Back to Jerry's after an implied date with Alicia]
JERRY: (to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
(Door buzzer)
JERRY: Yeah..
GEORGE: It's George.
JERRY: Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
KRAMER: So , you blew it?
JERRY: She must be psychotic or something.
KRAMER: Let me have her number.
JERRY: I'm not giving you her number.
KRAMER: I know how to handle these psychotics.
(George comes in wearing a huge cowboy hat.)
JERRY: Sheriff?........What's with the hat?
KRAMER: (George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
JERRY: What are doing here now?
GEORGE: I have to talk to you about something .
KRAMER: All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
GEORGE: Aahh..No..No..
JERRY: What's up?
GEORGE: I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
JERRY: So just start it.
GEORGE: I can't.
JERRY: Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
GEORGE: All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..
Kramer burst in with is video setup.
KRAMER: All right....Sit down George.
GEORGE: Kramer, can we do this later..
KRAMER: No, I got the tape right here.
JERRY: Kramer, let's do this later.
KRAMER: (ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
GEORGE: Really? ..You think.
JERRY: Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
KRAMER: 'bout what?
JERRY: It's kinda private.
KRAMER: Like the big toe captain..
GEORGE: So now you're doing my bits?
JERRY: I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
KRAMER: Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
JERRY: Does she know?
GEORGE: NO!!
JERRY: How did it happen?
GEORGE: I can't say.
JERRY: Well, why can't you say it?
GEORGE: Because I promised her.
JERRY: I thought you just said she doesn't know??
GEORGE: She doesn't.
JERRY: So how can you promise her?
GEORGE: Because she asked me to.
JERRY: What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
GEORGE: All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
JERRY: What, Elaine?
GEORGE: Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
JERRY: (picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
GEORGE: Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
JERRY: Wait a second. .Just give me a second
GEORGE: You heard it fifty times already.
JERRY: She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
(Door Buzzer)
JERRY: Yeaaaah!!!
ELAINE: Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
(George grabs his hat and rushes to the bathroom again.)
GEORGE: (Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
JERRY: Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
ELAINE: (Concerned) What's the matter?
JERRY: Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
ELAINE: (to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
JERRY: What are you doing here?
ELAINE: I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
JERRY: I know, George told me.
ELAINE: You told him!!!!
GEORGE: He..He threatened me.
JERRY: Where did you come up with all that stuff?
ELAINE: That was nothing.
GEORGE: Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
JERRY: George NO!!
GEORGE: No no no no no no no..
JERRY: George I'm telling ya..
ELAINE: What is it?
GEORGE: I'm very attracted to you..
JERRY: Aye......
(Kramer comes in and yells)
KRAMER: I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
GEORGE: Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
KRAMER: Whoa!!!....That was you?
ELAINE: It was a joke...
KRAMER: Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
ELAINE: Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
GEORGE: Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
JERRY: It's early.
KRAMER: We'll order Chinese.
(She leaves and they all scramble for the tape recorder.)
[Opening monologue]
Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to be two-and-a-half feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, I'd like to get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm allowed up here."
[Jerry and George are at a newsstand]
GEORGE: Where'd you meet her?
JERRY: I met her on an elevator.
GEORGE: On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
JERRY: Impossible, right?
GEORGE: You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
JERRY: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
GEORGE: Wow. What'd you say?
(flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator)
JERRY: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
(end of flashback)
GEORGE: Wow.
JERRY: Can you believe I did that?
GEORGE: What did she say?
(another flashback)
ISABEL: What crop circles?
(end of flashback)
JERRY: Not a good sign.
GEORGE: Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
NEWSSTAND OWNER: Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?
JERRY: You got something in your teeth there.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: It's green.
GEORGE: Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
JERRY: Did you bump into anybody you knew?
GEORGE: I had a job interview.
JERRY: How'd it go?
GEORGE: Take a guess.
(flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's spinached teeth.)
INTERVIEWER: Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time, but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.
GEORGE: Ok, thanks.
(end of flashback)
JERRY: What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
JERRY: What's the matter?
GEORGE: Oh, nothing.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: You won't think I'm a bad person?
JERRY: Too late for that.
GEORGE: 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
JERRY: Yeah, she's got a big nose.
GEORGE: I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
(momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose)
JERRY: It's a schnoz.
GEORGE: Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
JERRY: A little.
GEORGE: So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
JERRY: Stop being so concerned with looks.
(momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number)
JERRY: Have you said anything to her about it?
GEORGE: I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
JERRY: Alright, shut up, here they come.
GEORGE: (waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
[Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's apartment]
KRAMER: So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
ELAINE: Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
KRAMER: No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
ELAINE: Are you coming with me?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé, Peter Von Nostrand.
GEORGE: Why don't you just commit yourself already?
AUDREY: What is so special about this jacket?
ELAINE: He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
AUDREY: What's the smudge on your hand?
KRAMER: Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
GEORGE: What, you didn't wash all day?
KRAMER: Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
AUDREY: It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually find it kind of intimidating.
KRAMER: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
ELAINE: Kramer!
KRAMER: What? What?
ELAINE: How could you say something like that?!
KRAMER: What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
ELAINE: No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
AUDREY: No, it's ok.
ELAINE: What did you have to say that for?
KRAMER: Well, I was just trying to help out.
ELAINE: Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
KRAMER: You see what happens when you try to be nice?
[Middle Monologue]
But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." "That's ok, your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you very much."
[George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment]
AUDREY: Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back. What are you thinking about?
GEORGE: Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
AUDREY: You look like you've got something on your mind.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
AUDREY: How about him?
GEORGE: They way he just says stuff.
AUDREY: He sure does.
GEORGE: Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
AUDREY: So, what did you think?
GEORGE: About the pizza?
AUDREY: No, about the nose job.
GEORGE: Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
AUDREY: Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.
GEORGE: Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
AUDREY: I know, they're good.
GEORGE: Peter Jennings had one.
AUDREY: Really?
GEORGE: Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
AUDREY: Uh huh.
GEORGE: It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
AUDREY: I hate the dentist.
GEORGE: It's a cleaning.
AUDREY: So you really think I should do this?
GEORGE: If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
AUDREY: Well, maybe I should.
GEORGE: What the hell.
ELAINE: (barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
GEORGE: Me? I didn't say anything.
ELAINE: You encouraged her to get one.
GEORGE: I didn't encourage. No encourage.
ELAINE: Peter Jennings had one?
GEORGE: It's possible.
ELAINE: Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
AUDREY: No, George is right. I want to get one.
ELAINE: I think it's a mistake.
GEORGE: Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop]
GEORGE: I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
JERRY: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
GEORGE: (checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
JERRY: We have time.
GEORGE: It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
JERRY: It is exciting.
GEORGE: Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
JERRY: Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
GEORGE: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
JERRY: Then what?
GEORGE: He still wins but it's not a blowout.
JERRY: She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
(flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment)
JERRY: (holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
KRAMER: (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
(end of flashback)
JERRY: So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
GEORGE: Good for you.
JERRY: I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
GEORGE: It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
JERRY: It's not like that at all.
[Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment]
ELAINE: How do you even know the jacket is there?
KRAMER: Well I don't, I'm guessing.
GEORGE: Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
AUDREY: George?
GEORGE: Yeah?
AUDREY: Enough.
JERRY: Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
ELAINE: Are you sure you want us here for this?
AUDREY: Yes.
JERRY: Shouldn't a doctor do it?
AUDREY: No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.
GEORGE: Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
(Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their horror.)
ELAINE: It looks good.
JERRY: Great job.
KRAMER: You got butchered.
(George faints)
(An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.)
JERRY: Let's put him over here.
KRAMER: (to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
AUDREY: (with hand covering nose) To the doctor!
KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
(Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George.)
ELAINE: How ya feeling?
GEORGE: Too much salt in my diet.
ELAINE: Can I get you anything?
GEORGE: Nah, I'm good.
ELAINE: You sure? Anything?
GEORGE: Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
ELAINE: No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
GEORGE: It's like, all dented.
ELAINE: Seems to be.
GEORGE: Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
ELAINE: Shut up, George.
GEORGE: Shut up?
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Interesting.
[Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal, Jerry has cracked.]
JERRY: Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
KRAMER: I don't have it, I threw it out.
JERRY: You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
KRAMER: I told you, I threw it out.
JERRY: Give it to me!
KRAMER: You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
JERRY: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
KRAMER: You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
JERRY: I was lying, give it to me!
KRAMER: No, you told me not to!
JERRY: I want that number!
KRAMER: Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
(Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl, then storms out again.)
[George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose, George is trying not to look at it.]
AUDREY: The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum. Over here...
GEORGE: Yeah.
AUDREY: You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
GEORGE: Oh, I got it.
AUDREY: You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.
GEORGE: Yeah, phew.
AUDREY: So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?
GEORGE: What?
AUDREY: Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
GEORGE: We did?
AUDREY: Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?
GEORGE: Hawaii?
AUDREY: Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.
GEORGE: (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
AUDREY: I never heard that.
GEORGE: Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
AUDREY: We could go to the Caribbean.
GEORGE: You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
AUDREY: George, I don't think this is working.
[Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.]
ISABEL: Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.
JERRY: I'm Nelson!
ISABEL: That's not the line, Jerry.
JERRY: Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
ISABEL: I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go crazy thinking about you.
JERRY: Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
ISABEL: Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.
JERRY: (to himself: Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
(Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.)
JERRY'S BRAIN: Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we play one for all the marbles?
JERRY'S PENIS: Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!
JERRY'S BRAIN: I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little acting scenes.
JERRY'S PENIS: Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour, then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.
JERRY'S BRAIN: What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do whatever it is you do. You disgust me.
JERRY'S PENIS: Oh, go read a book.
JERRY'S BRAIN: Enough chatting, let's play.
[Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.]
ELAINE: You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
KRAMER: (filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
ELAINE: Yeah.
KRAMER: Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
ELAINE: What do I need this for?
KRAMER: Because we're engaged.
ELAINE: We're engaged?
KRAMER: Um hm.
ELAINE: Kramer, this is too big.
KRAMER: (lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.
(A stout man walks around the corner.)
LANDLORD: Hello?
ELAINE: Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
LANDLORD: Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And you must be Professor Von Nostrand?
KRAMER: Yes, yes I am.
LANDLORD: I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.
KRAMER: Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
LANDLORD: Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?
KRAMER: My contention?
LANDLORD: Yes, your contention.
KRAMER: Yes, that's my contention.
ELAINE: I heard him contend that.
LANDLORD: It's too bad about your father.
ELAINE: Oh, it was a frame-up.
LANDLORD: A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work you're doing.
ELAINE: Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
KRAMER: She does fine work.
LANDLORD: Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this way.
ELAINE: How kind of you.
LANDLORD: You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.
(Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.)
(Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have the upper hand.)
JERRY'S BRAIN: What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha ha!
ISABEL: Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of you.
JERRY'S PENIS: It's killing me. (Makes a move)
JERRY'S BRAIN: That's your move?
JERRY'S PENIS: Yeah.
JERRY'S BRAIN: Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!
JERRY'S PENIS: (beginning to cough and struggle) Getting weak... Losing power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing without me. Nothing!
(Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop)
JERRY'S BRAIN: (before disappearing himself) Punk.
JERRY: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
(Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face)
[Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment]
ELAINE: Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
LANDLORD: He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite popular with the ladies.
ELAINE: My father, really? I had no idea.
LANDLORD: Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs
Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken stumblebum.
KRAMER: You don't say?
ELAINE: I found it!
LANDLORD: The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees, screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring back that box of Danish!"
(Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated. Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.)
[The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.]
KRAMER: So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
ELAINE: Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
JERRY: So I assume the jig was up.
ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much.
(Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful)
AUDREY: Hi.
ELAINE: Hi!
JERRY: Hey.
AUDREY: (to George) Hello.
GEORGE: (smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
AUDREY: (motioning to Kramer) Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.
ELAINE: So, will I see you later tonight?
AUDREY: Not sure.
KRAMER: (rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
AUDREY: (holding up her hand to show the stamp) I didn't wash.
KRAMER: Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
ELAINE: (after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
GEORGE: (interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
[Closing Monologue]
The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to perform a cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."
[Opening monologue]
So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication.  You ever try and pick one of these out?  It's not easy.  It's a wall.  It's an entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright, alright, alright, okay, what the hell--  This is quick acting, but this is long lasting.  When do I need to feel good, now or later?"  It's a tough question. And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong with the guy, you know?  They always show you, like, all the problems that he's having.  First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this guy.  No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public.  And he's always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him. I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?"  "Yes I am."  "Are you having any lightning with the pain?"
[Jerry and George are in a drug store.]
JERRY:  How did you get fleas?
GEORGE:  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
JERRY:  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
GEORGE:  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?
JERRY:  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
GEORGE:  You know Ava's gonna be there.
JERRY:  Who?
GEORGE:  The nice one that works in my office.
JERRY:  Nah.
GEORGE:  I'll drive.
JERRY:  Oh, well, now you're talking.
GEORGE:  It's supposed to be a good party.
JERRY:  What does that mean, good dip?
GEORGE:  No, there'll be girls there.
JERRY:  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
GEORGE:  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between these two?  (They each grab a box and check the ingredients)  You got propylparabin?
JERRY:  Got it.
GEORGE:  You got isobutane-30?
JERRY:  I got isobutane-20.
GEORGE:  A-ha.
JERRY:  You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?
GEORGE:  Got it.
JERRY:  I have aloe!
GEORGE:  You got aloe?  I love aloe.
JERRY:  Where do they make yours?
GEORGE:  Jersey.
JERRY:  White Plains.
(George puts down the "Jersey" box and grabs the "White Plains" box from Jerry and they go to the check out counter.  Two women are standing at the magazine rack in the background.)
JERRY:  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there.  What's the matter?
GEORGE:  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
JERRY:  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.
GEORGE: (to the cashier)  Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
CASHIER:  You gave me a ten.
GEORGE:  I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
CASHIER:  I know what you gave me.
GEORGE:  You owe me ten dollars.
CASHIER:  Will you please step aside?  Next?
GEORGE:  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--
CASHIER:  You.
GEORGE:  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
SECURITY GUARD:  What's the problem here?
GEORGE:  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
CASHIER:  He's claiming short.
SECURITY GUARD:  Alright, let's just take it outside.
GEORGE:  Oh, so you don't believe me either?
SECURITY GUARD:  Come on, let's go.
GEORGE:  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.
[George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door]
ELAINE:  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
JERRY:  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.
GEORGE: (waving:  Eva.
(A beautiful woman starts walking over.)
JERRY:  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
AVA:  So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.
GEORGE:  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?
AVA:  Yesterday
GEORGE:  I don't believe it.
AVA:  Ask Mark.
GEORGE:  Mark, is this true?
(A man across the room nods.  George and Ava walk towards him.)
JERRY:  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
ELAINE:  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
JERRY:  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
ELAINE:  How old are you?
JERRY:  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no, no, I got a better one.  Head patting.
ELAINE:  Whatever you want.
(Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.)
GUY:  You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?
JERRY:  Yeah, yeah I did.
GUY:  So what do you do?
JERRY: (Patting his head:  I'm a comedian.
GUY:  Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?
JERRY: (still Patting)  I hear a voice.
GUY:  What kind of voice?
JERRY:  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
GUY:  How come you keep tapping your head.
JERRY:  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.
(Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.)
GUY:  On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for something.
(Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.)
GUY:  Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.
(Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.)
GUY:  I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.
ELAINE:  Yeah, me too.
GUY:  Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.
(Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.)
GEORGE:  How's it going?
JERRY:  Great, how about you?
GEORGE:  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
JERRY:  How do you account for this?
GEORGE:  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
JERRY:  Well, she obviously liked you all along.
GEORGE:  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
JERRY:  Anyway, I'm ready to go.
GEORGE:  Now?
JERRY:  If not now, when?
GEORGE:  Gimme a half-hour.
JERRY:  Okay, half-hour.
(Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from tapping.)
GUY:  Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...
JERRY: (interrupting)  Can I talk to you for a second?
ELAINE:  Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.
JERRY:  Hey, I was dying over there.
ELAINE:  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.
(Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.)
ELLEN:  Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of everyday things, right?
JERRY:  Right.
ELLEN:  Yeah, I remember you.
(Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch near a pretentious woman.)
WOMAN:  I wonder what happened to my fiancé.  I know he's here somewhere. Ellen?  Have you seen my fiancé?
ELLEN:  He's upstairs.
WOMAN:  Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.  I havelost my fiancé, the poor baby.
ELAINE:  Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
WOMAN:  What?
ELAINE:  The dingo ate your baby!
(Cut to George and Jerry.)
JERRY:  You ready?
GEORGE:  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
JERRY:  I do favors.
GEORGE:  I think something's happening here.
JERRY:  What?
GEORGE:  I think she wants me to take her home.
JERRY:  Wow.
GEORGE:  What should I do?
JERRY:  Go!  What could you do?
GEORGE:  What about you and Elaine?
JERRY:  We'll get a ride.
GEORGE:  Are you sure?
JERRY:  We'll be fine, what did she say?
GEORGE:  She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes)  She told me she wants me to make love to her.
JERRY:  What?  She said that?
GEORGE:  Yeah.
JERRY:  Get out of here.
GEORGE:  I swear.
JERRY:  What did you say?
GEORGE:  I, I, I can't.
JERRY:  What did you say?
GEORGE:  Please, it's--
JERRY:  What?
GEORGE:  I... I... I long for you.
JERRY:  I long for you?
GEORGE:  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
JERRY:  It's okay, that's not bad.
GEORGE:  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
JERRY:  Really?
GEORGE:  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
JERRY:  Oh, come on.
GEORGE:  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
JERRY:  George, you're thinking too much.
GEORGE:  I know, I know, I can't stop it!
(Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.)
ELAINE:  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
JERRY: (walking up)  Pendant?  Those bastards.
ELAINE:  Excuse me.
JERRY:  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
ELAINE:  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?
JERRY:  Uh, no, he's taking the car.
ELAINE:  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
JERRY:  I don't know.
ELAINE:  You don't know?
JERRY:  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
ELAINE:  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?
JERRY:  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
[Middle monologue]
All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other ever in life.  This is the male code.  And it doesn't matter how important the arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch pad.  They hold that countdown.  He's leaning against the rocket talking to her, "So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"
[Still at the Party]
ELAINE: (noticing Ava in a fur)  Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
JERRY:  Yeah, yeah, alright.
ELAINE:  I can't believe she's walking around in that.
JERRY:  Just don't make a scene.
ELAINE:  Hey, is that real fur?
JERRY:  Oh boy.
AVA:  It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.
GEORGE:  Yeah, good night.
ELAINE:  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
GEORGE:  Could we talk about this some other time?
AVA:  Are you a vegetarian?
JERRY:  Here we go.
ELAINE:  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
AVA:  So you're a hypocrite.
GEORGE:  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-
AVA:  Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.
ELAINE:  Fish don't feel any pain.
AVA:  How do you know?  Do you communicate with fish?
ELAINE:  Well, they're not kept in little cages.
AVA:  Ever seen a goldfish?
GEORGE:  Goldfish.
ELAINE:  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.
AVA:  Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down the toilet, that's a good life.  (To George)  Let's go.
ELAINE:  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
GEORGE:  That's why we're here in America.
JERRY:  You're beautiful.
ELAINE:  Call Kramer.
JERRY:  Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, this is your party, right?
STEVE:  No, I just live here.
JERRY:  Can I use your phone?
STEVE:  What's in it for me?
JERRY:  A bigger bill?
STEVE:  He he, go for it.
(Jerry picks up the phone and dials.)
JERRY:  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.
(Cut to several hours later.  The party has ended.  The hosts, Steve and Jenny, are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.)
ELAINE:  You sure you don't need any help?
JENNY:  No, not really.
JERRY:  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
JENNY: (To Steve)  I want them out of here.
ELAINE:  Call him again.
JERRY:  I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
JENNY: (To Steve)  It's two o'clock in the morning.
JERRY: (noticing a coffee table book)  Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
ELAINE:  Six hundred and twenty million people died.
JERRY:  Thousand.
ELAINE:  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror. (To Jerry)  The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
JERRY:  Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's nothing we can do?
JENNY:  No!  (To Steve)  I am not going to bed with them in our house, this is ridiculous.
JERRY:  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.
ELAINE:  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
JENNY:  You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.
JERRY:  Oh, he's coming.
JENNY:  Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.
(Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.)
JERRY:  That's him.
JENNY:  I'm going to bed!
ELAINE:  Thanks a lot.
JERRY:  Thanks, great party.
(As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.)
KRAMER:  Hey, how ya doing?
STEVE:  Ah, look who's here.
KRAMER:  I'm sorry.
JERRY:  Hey, it's okay.
KRAMER:  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
ELAINE:  Then how did you find the place?
KRAMER:  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it.  8173.
JERRY:  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
STEVE:  No problem.
JERRY:  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
STEVE:  Hey, I might take you up on that.
JERRY: (writing)  Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.
KRAMER: (to Elaine)  You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
ELAINE:  But it's cold out.
KRAMER:  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
[Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.]
JERRY:  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.
(Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.)
JERRY:  Who is it?
VOICE:  Mr. Pocatello.
JERRY:  Who?
VOICE:  You mean you don't recognize my voice?
(Jerry opens the door.  Steve steps in.)
STEVE:  Jerry, baby!
JERRY:  Do I know you?
STEVE:  Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.
JERRY:  I'm sorry, uh-
STEVE:  See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.
JERRY:  Oh, okay.
STEVE:  You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.
JERRY:  You certainly are.  What's going on?
STEVE:  I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see what it was like to hang out with someone in show business.
JERRY:  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
STEVE:  Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.
JERRY:  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
STEVE:  I understand.
JERRY:  Look, you can hang out here if you want.
STEVE:  Don't be so enthusiastic.
JERRY:  No, it's-
STEVE:  I'm not gonna steal anything.
JERRY:  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
STEVE:  I think I can do that.
JERRY:  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.
STEVE:  Yeah.  Let's have lunch.
[Jerry and George are at the drug store.]
JERRY:  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
GEORGE:  Yeah, me either.
JERRY:  Oh, come on.
GEORGE:  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
JERRY:  I've never had a job.
GEORGE:  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
JERRY:  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
GEORGE:  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'
JERRY:  What are you gonna do?
GEORGE:  I have no choice, I'm quitting.
[Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV.  Kramer walks in and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.]
KRAMER:  The party, Long Island?
STEVE:  Kramer, right?
KRAMER:  Hey, what are you doing here?
STEVE:  I'm waiting for my ride.
KRAMER:  Where's Jerry?
STEVE:  He split.  Let me ask you something.  Is there anything to drink in here or is that, like, a stupid question?
KRAMER:  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.  (Sensing Steve's disappointment)  Well, but I might have something.
[Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.  Jerry is selecting medication.]
JERRY:  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.
GEORGE:  How much is that?
JERRY:  Nine sixty.
GEORGE:  Nine sixty?  Give it to me.
JERRY:  Why?
GEORGE:  Don't worry, I got it.
JERRY:  What do you mean, you got it?
GEORGE:  I got it.
(George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket)
JERRY:  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're stealing this, aren't you?
GEORGE:  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.
JERRY:  You're a lunatic.
GEORGE:  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
JERRY:  What do you say to a person like you?
GEORGE:  Just walk.
JERRY:  Oh.
(A security guard approaches George.)
SECURITY GUARD:  Scuse me.  What do you got there?
GEORGE:  What?
SECURITY GUARD:  What do you got in your shirt?
GEORGE:  Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
SECURITY GUARD: (grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter) Come with me.
GEORGE: (nervous)  Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.
CASHIER: um-hmm.
SECURITY GUARD:  You don't think I remember you?
GEORGE: (more nervous)  What are you talking about?
SECURITY GUARD:  I know who you are, I was watching you.
GEORGE: (panicky)  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?
(The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.)
JERRY:  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
[Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.  Kramer is in the middle of a story.]
KRAMER:  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!
(They both erupt in raucous laughter.)
STEVE: (hysterical)  Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!! (the laughter winds down) So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?
KRAMER:  Not really.
STEVE:  Maybe we should call one of those escort services.  I saw one of them advertised before on the cable station.
KRAMER: (handing Steve the phone)  555-LOVE.
STEVE:  Hey, you want in on this?
KRAMER:  No, I got a girl in the next building
[Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's voice from inside.]
VOICE:  Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it.  Now I am through playing games with you, I got things to do.
STEVE: (drunk and slurring)  Oh Jerry!  Jerry!  Look who's here, it's Jerry
JERRY:  What the hell?
STEVE:  Jerry, this is Patti.
JERRY:  Nice to meet you.
PATTI:  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.
JERRY:  What the hell is going on here?
STEVE:  I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.  (The buzzer goes off) Ooh, there's my ride, finally.
PATTI:  I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.
STEVE:  See ya, Jerr.  And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.
JERRY:  Oh, Kramer huh?
STEVE:  Yeah, he's a hoot.  Oh, goodbye, my dear.  (trying to kiss Patti's hand as she pulls it away)  Ouch.  (To Jerry)  Weekend of the 26th, come on out, we're having another party.
(Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.)
PATTI:  I ain't leaving.
JERRY:  Patti?
PATTI:  You got anything to drink?
JERRY:  Alright, how much does he owe you?
PATTI:  Fifty dollars.
JERRY: (taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly)  Fifty dollars.
(In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.)
COP:  This your apartment?
JERRY:  Yeah, but--
COP:  You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.
JERRY:  Wait a second, I--
(Elaine walks in.)
ELAINE:  I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti)  Is that real fur?
JERRY & COP:  Oh boy.
[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.]
GEORGE:  You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.
JERRY:  He was a nice guy.
GEORGE:  Oh, great guy.
JERRY:  Was there a red-headed guy there?
GEORGE:  The one with the long sideburns?
JERRY:  Yeah.
GEORGE:  Where does he come off?
JERRY:  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.
GEORGE:  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
JERRY:  Oh, we all hated him.
[Closing monologue]
There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor.  You can measure the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do me a favor.'  Small favor, small pause.  Can you do me a favor, hand me that pencil?  No pause at all.  Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...' (huge pause, followed by closing credits.)
[Opening monologue]
Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it, it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would like a car alarm like that.
[Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
GEORGE: Was the alarm on?
JERRY: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
GEORGE: I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
JERRY: They cross the wires or something.
GEORGE: Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
(Kramer enters.)
JERRY: They stole my car.
KRAMER: Who did?
JERRY: They did.
KRAMER: Was it more than just one?
JERRY: What should I do, should I call the police?
KRAMER: What are they gonna do?
JERRY: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
GEORGE: Maybe you should call your car phone.
JERRY: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
GEORGE: Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
JERRY: Are you serious?
GEORGE: Yeah, go ahead, call.
JERRY: I don't even know if I remember the number.
(Jerry dials.)
JERRY: What do I say if he picks up?
CAR THIEF: Hello?
JERRY: Hello? Is this 555-8383?
CAR THIEF: I have no idea.
JERRY: Can I ask you a question?
CAR THIEF: Sure.
JERRY: Did you steal my car?
CAR THIEF: Yes I did.
JERRY: You did?!
CAR THIEF: I did.
JERRY: That's my car!
CAR THIEF: I didn't know it was yours.
JERRY: What are you gonna do with it?
CAR THIEF: I dunno, drive around.
JERRY: Then can I have it back?
CAR THIEF: Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.
(Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.)
KRAMER: Hello?
CAR THIEF: Yeah, who's this?
KRAMER: Kramer.
CAR THIEF: Hello, Kramer.
KRAMER: Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
CAR THIEF: Wait, hold on... Brown ones?
KRAMER: Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
CAR THIEF: One-two-nine, okay.
KRAMER: Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
JERRY: (derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
CAR THIEF: Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
CAR THIEF: I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.
JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
CAR THIEF: Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find the--
(Jerry hangs up.)
JERRY: Sid left the keys in the car.
GEORGE: Who's Sid?
JERRY: He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
GEORGE: What do you mean?
JERRY: He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
GEORGE: What, do you pay him for that?
JERRY: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
GEORGE: How many people does he do that for?
JERRY: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
KRAMER: He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
GEORGE: Could anybody do that?
(Sid enters.)
JERRY: Hey Sid, what happened?
SID: I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.
JERRY: You left the keys in the car?
SID: Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little distracted.
KRAMER: You know I'm in that movie?
GEORGE: You are?
KRAMER: Yeah, I'm an extra.
GEORGE: How'd you get that?
KRAMER: Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
GEORGE: Right out of the clear blue sky?
KRAMER: Clear blue sky!
GEORGE: Well, why didn't they ask me?
KRAMER: I got a quality.
SID: Jerry, you got insurance, right?
JERRY: Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
SID: Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a week, so I can't park it.
JERRY: This Wednesday?
SID: No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.
JERRY: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
SID: If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the week after this Wednesday.
GEORGE: Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
SID: Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move themselves if they want.
GEORGE: Maybe I could move them until you get back.
SID: What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?
GEORGE: I'm in a transition phase right now.
SID: Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to take the keys out, that's all.
(Phone rings.)
JERRY: Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
[Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.]
ELAINE: I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
JERRY: Owen March, I never heard of him.
ELAINE: Well, he's not a baseball player.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
ELAINE: Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
JERRY: What's that?
ELAINE: He's sixty-six years old.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Next please.
ELAINE: Well, go, go.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Can I help you? Name please?
JERRY: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Okay, let's see here.
JERRY: Sixty-six years old?
ELAINE: Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
JERRY: Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
ELAINE: What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
JERRY: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.
JERRY: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.
JERRY: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: I know why we have reservations.
JERRY: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.
(The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen speaking with someone.)
JERRY: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
ELAINE: Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
JERRY: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
ELAINE: Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
(The agent returns.)
RENTAL CAR AGENT: I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.
JERRY: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: But we do have a compact if you would like that.
JERRY: Fine.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you like insurance?
JERRY: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Please fill this out.
ELAINE: What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
JERRY: Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
ELAINE: I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
[Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.]
ELAINE: I just don't enjoy being with him.
JERRY: Well that's what's important.
ELAINE: I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
JERRY: How many times you been out with him?
ELAINE: Seven?
JERRY: Face to face.
ELAINE: Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
JERRY: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
ELAINE: Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way and heads for the kitchen sink.
KRAMER: Whoa, whoa!!
JERRY: What is going on out there?
GEORGE: I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
(George runs off into the bathroom.)
KRAMER: Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
ELAINE: Today?!
KRAMER: You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
ELAINE: Yeah.
KRAMER: So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
ELAINE: He was laughing?!
KRAMER: Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
JERRY: So then what?
KRAMER: I got a line in the movie!
ELAINE: Get out!
JERRY: That's great!
GEORGE: You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
KRAMER: Pretty good, huh?
GEORGE: You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
JERRY: You mean *a* career.
ELAINE: So was Mia Farrow there?
KRAMER: Uh, I didn't see him.
ELAINE: What's your line?
KRAMER: Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
(The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.)
KRAMER: So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
GEORGE: Is that how you're gonna say it?
KRAMER: No, no, I'm working on it.
ELAINE: Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
JERRY: No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
KRAMER: No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
GEORGE: "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
(Jerry pinches his nose.)
GEORGE: That was no good?
KRAMER: I didn't say anything.
ELAINE: I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
GEORGE: What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
(George storms out.)
[Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.]
JERRY: Oh my god.
ELAINE: Call an ambulance.
JERRY: Boy, he took it hard.
[Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.]
ELAINE: We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
JERRY: (on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
ELAINE: Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
JERRY: (To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
JERRY: Kramer.
KRAMER: What happened here?
ELAINE: I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
JERRY: Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
ELAINE: What extremities?
KRAMER: What's an extremity?
JERRY: You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
KRAMER: You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
ELAINE: Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
JERRY: I don't have a washcloth.
ELAINE: Well use a paper towel.
JERRY: You can't put a paper towel on his head.
KRAMER: What about a big sponge?
JERRY: How you gonna hold it on there?
KRAMER: Use a belt.
ELAINE: No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
JERRY: Should we walk him around?
ELAINE and KRAMER: (at the same time) Yes, yes.
KRAMER: Yeah, I've seen them do that.
JERRY: No, no that's for a drug overdose.
KRAMER: Maybe that's what he's got.
ELAINE: No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
KRAMER: Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
ELAINE: He is not a drug addict!
JERRY: Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
ELAINE: A cookie!
KRAMER: Can you give him a cookie?
ELAINE: How's he gonna chew it?
JERRY: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
(Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.)
ELAINE: Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
KRAMER: I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
ELAINE: You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
JERRY: Cookies don't liquefy.
ELAINE: Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
KRAMER: Alright I'll get a blender.
JERRY: What blender? I don't have a blender.
KRAMER: You got a blender.
JERRY: I would know if I had a blender.
ELAINE: Where is the ambulance?!
(Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a crashing sound.)
(The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.)
JERRY: (on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
ELAINE: I can't believe what's going on out here.
JERRY: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
VOICE: Paramedics.
JERRY: Come on up. Okay, they're here.
ELAINE: He seems to be breathing.
JERRY: Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
ELAINE: I know.
JERRY: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
ELAINE: Almost.
JERRY: Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
ELAINE: It's not an easy thing to bring up.
JERRY: Yeah, that's true.
ELAINE: Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
JERRY: Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
ELAINE: He does, how'd you know that?
JERRY: I could tell.
(Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.)
ELAINE: What happened, what took you so long?!
PARAMEDIC: We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into us with a blue Escort.
JERRY: Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
(George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.)
GEORGE: Oh man.
JERRY: What happened to the car?
GEORGE: Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
ELAINE: This guy I'm seeing.
GEORGE: What happened?
JERRY: We don't know!
PARAMEDIC: Who put cookies in his mouth?
JERRY and ELAINE: Cookies?
PARAMEDIC: You're not supposed to do that.
JERRY: So how'd you hit the car?
GEORGE: I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
JERRY: It's not even my car, it's a rental.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
GEORGE: Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
KRAMER: He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
GEORGE: Should I apologize to Woody?
KRAMER: Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
[Middle Monologue]
What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment. Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid. They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.'
[Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment.]
SID: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have mentioned that.
GEORGE: Well I know how to drive.
SID: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.
JERRY: Can I get anybody anything?
SID: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your pants on?
GEORGE: I put my pants on, Sid.
SID: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.
GEORGE: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
SID: Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't park a few cars.
GEORGE: Maybe I could call my father.
(Kramer enters holding a newspaper.)
KRAMER: Hey, you seen the paper yet?
JERRY: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
KRAMER: Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
JERRY: (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
KRAMER: Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
JERRY: (continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
SID: Oh lord.
JERRY: (finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
[Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of pretzels.]
ELAINE: Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
JERRY: Can he communicate?
ELAINE: Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
JERRY: Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
ELAINE: So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
JERRY: What community? There's a community?
ELAINE: Of course there's a community.
JERRY: All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred and sixty-six dollars.
JERRY: Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of the car at the time of the accident.
JERRY: That is right, somebody else was driving.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.
JERRY: Uh huh, what's that?
RENTAL CAR AGENT: You're not covered for other drivers.
JERRY: Other drivers?
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Um hm.
JERRY: Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Not that particular one.
JERRY: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--
JERRY: Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
RENTAL CAR AGENT: Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.
JERRY: These pretzels are making me thirsty.
[Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup]
ELAINE: Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
[Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.]
ELAINE: Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
JERRY: An overdose of odor? Good question.
GEORGE: Do I smell?
ELAINE: No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
JERRY: Ahh.
GEORGE: He's alright?
ELAINE: Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
(The waitress brings the check.)
JERRY: Let me get that.
GEORGE: No no no, I got it.
JERRY: Please.
GEORGE: No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
(Kramer enters and sits down.)
JERRY: What are you doing here?
KRAMER: I got fired from the movie.
GEORGE: Get out of here, why?
KRAMER: Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
ELAINE: Aww.
KRAMER: Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
(Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.)
JERRY: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
[Closing monologue]
I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And the best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to get married, you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, all I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. Do you take this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. Rest of the time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the sniffles, you better be there.
[At the comedy club]
JERRY: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
[At a party]
JERRY: Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
GEORGE: Like you do.
JERRY: Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
GEORGE: What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
JERRY: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
GEORGE: Why did France give that to us anyway?
JERRY: It was a gift.
GEORGE: So countries just exchange gifts like that?
JERRY: If they like each other.
GEORGE: There's Elaine.
JERRY: See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
GEORGE: Really? They work here in the office?
JERRY: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
GEORGE: Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
JERRY: You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
GEORGE: "Off the wagon"?
JERRY: I think it's off the wagon.
GEORGE: I think it's "on the wagon".
ELAINE: Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
JERRY: What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
ELAINE: *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
JERRY: Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
ELAINE: Where did you find it?
JERRY: Under the sofa cushion.
ELAINE: And you stopped by just to give it to me?
JERRY: It's your Christmas present.
ELAINE: I though I'd never find it.
GEORGE: Well today's your lucky day.
ELAINE: No. Today's *your* lucky day.
GEORGE: It will be my first one.
ELAINE: You want to work here?
GEORGE: Huh?
ELAINE: Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
DICK: Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
JERRY: "The guy?"
ELAINE: (softly to Dick) Dick.
GEORGE: How can you just get it?
ELAINE: My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
JERRY: Cranberry juice?
ELAINE: And vodka.
DICK: I got the cranberry juice.
DICK: So... you're Jerry.
JERRY: So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
MR. LIPPMAN: (What is his name?) So have you ever done this kind of work before?
GEORGE: Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
MR. LIPPMAN: How do you read?
GEORGE: I like Mike Lubika.
MR. LIPPMAN: Mike Lubika?
GEORGE: He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
MR. LIPPMAN: No, no, no. I mean authors.
GEORGE: Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
MR. LIPPMAN: Name a couple.
GEORGE: Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
MR. LIPPMAN: Art Vandelay?
GEORGE: He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
MR. LIPPMAN: What has he written?
GEORGE: Venetian Blinds.
DICK: (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.
JERRY: Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
ELAINE: Where's my drink?
JERRY: There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
GEORGE: I think he was impressed.
ELAINE: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
JERRY: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
ELAINE: Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
JERRY: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
ELAINE: One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
GEORGE: Told you.
[At a clothing store]
JERRY: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
GEORGE: Do I really have to buy her something?
JERRY: Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
GEORGE: What is that? Is that cashmere?
JERRY: Yeah. She would love cashmere.
GEORGE: Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
JERRY: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
GEORGE: Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
SALES WOMAN: Yes?
GEORGE: How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
SALES WOMAN: (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.
GEORGE: What? I don't see anything.
SALES WOMAN: See this red dot?
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
JERRY: Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
GEORGE: (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
SALES WOMAN: There's no exchanges on this.
GEORGE: You think she would care about the red dot?
JERRY: It's hard to say.
GEORGE: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
JERRY: Well I can see it.
GEORGE: Yeah, but you know where it is.
JERRY: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
GEORGE: Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
JERRY: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
GEORGE: Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
JERRY: You want me to take an overview?
GEORGE: Please.
JERRY: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
[At Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: Yeah so?
ELAINE: He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
JERRY: Oh boy, can you smell it?
ELAINE: No. I can't smell it.
JERRY: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
ELAINE: You don't always smell someone from a drink.
JERRY: Yes you do.
ELAINE: What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
JERRY: Yes you would.
(Kramer enters)
JERRY: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
KRAMER: Okay.
JERRY: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
KRAMER: You can smell me without the drink.
ELAINE: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
KRAMER: Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
JERRY: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
(Kramer drinks.)
KRAMER: All right.
(Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.)
JERRY: I don't smell anything.
ELAINE: Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: (over the speaker) It's George.
JERRY: Come on up.
KRAMER: That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
GEORGE: Hello everybody.
KRAMER: Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
GEORGE: (uncomfortablly) Thank you.
ELAINE: Hey what's that?
GEORGE: It's an early Christmas present.
ELAINE: Christmas present? For who?
GEORGE: For you.
ELAINE: *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
KRAMER: Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
JERRY: Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
ELAINE: (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.
ELAINE: Oh, I love cashmere.
GEORGE: Well who doesn't.
ELAINE: My, George this must have cost a fortune.
GEORGE: Ahh, money.
ELAINE: Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
JERRY: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
ELAINE: George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
GEORGE: Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
KRAMER: What's that red dot on your sweater?
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
ELAINE: Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
GEORGE: What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
JERRY: (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
ELAINE: What don't you know?
JERRY: I don't know.
ELAINE: Well do you see it or don't you?
JERRY: Ahem. Say that again?
ELAINE: Do you see it or don't you?
JERRY: Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
(Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.)
JERRY: Now what did you ask me again.
(Kramer is snoring.)
[At the office. Elaine is walking by]
ELAINE: You're still here. You're a dynamo.
GEORGE: I can't believe I get paid for this.
ELAINE: I'll see you tomorrow.
(Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.)
GEORGE: How you doing?
CLEANING WOMAN: Hello.
(The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning.)
[At Monk's]
JERRY: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
GEORGE: Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
JERRY: Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
GEORGE: Why is that?
JERRY: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
GEORGE: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
JERRY: Convulsing?
GEORGE: Convulsing?
JERRY: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
GEORGE: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
JERRY: You don't drink.
GEORGE: I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
JERRY: So you started drinking.
GEORGE: So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
JERRY: So how was it?
GEORGE: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
JERRY: Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
[At Jerry's apartment]
ELAINE: Dick was fired.
JERRY: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
ELAINE: You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
JERRY: What are you saying?
ELAINE: I'm not saying anything.
JERRY: You're saying something.
ELAINE: What could I be saying?
JERRY: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
ELAINE: If I was saying something I would have said it.
JERRY: Well why don't you say it?
ELAINE: I said it.
JERRY: What did you say?
ELAINE: Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
(Jerry's buzzer buzzes.)
JERRY: Yeah?
GEORGE: (over the speaker) It's George.
JERRY: Come on up.
ELAINE: Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
JERRY: No I didn't.
ELAINE: Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
JERRY: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
ELAINE: How much did he save?
JERRY: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
(Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.)
GEORGE: I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
JERRY: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
GEORGE: Did you tell her anything?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: Do you swear?
JERRY: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
GEORGE: Oh you told her didn't you.
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
GEORGE: What? Did I what?
ELAINE: You did didn't you.
GEORGE: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
ELAINE: Well Jerry told me that you did.
GEORGE: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
JERRY: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
GEORGE: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
[At the office.]
GEORGE: This is for you.
CLEANING WOMAN: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.
GEORGE: As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
CLEANING WOMAN: Okay, okay, can I open it now?
GEORGE: Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
CLEANING WOMAN: Oh! Is that cashmere?
GEORGE: Of course it's cashemere.
CLEANING WOMAN: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
GEORGE: Just a little something for Christmas.
CLEANING WOMAN: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, "what do you call this most beautiful fabric?", and he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked if I could have it, and he said "No. Get away from me." Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.
GEORGE: I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
CLEANING WOMAN: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.
GEORGE: Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
CLEANING WOMAN: (noticing the dot) What's this?
[At the comedy club]
JERRY: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
DICK: The only stench is comming from you.
AUDIENCE: Oooooh.
JERRY: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
DICK: It's off the wagon.
JERRY: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
DICK: I don't know.
JERRY: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
DICK: You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.
JERRY: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
DICK: What the hell do you know about wagons?
JERRY: I know enough not to get on them.
[In the Lippman's office.]
MR. LIPPMAN: I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
GEORGE: Who said that?
MR. LIPPMAN: She did.
GEORGE: Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
MR. LIPPMAN: You're fired.
GEORGE: Well you didn't have to say it like that.
MR. LIPPMAN: I want you out of here by the end of the day.
GEORGE: What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
MR. LIPPMAN: Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.
(He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office "wearing" it. )
[In the hall of the office]
ELAINE: You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
GEORGE: You never had sex in the office before?
ELAINE: No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
GEORGE: Alright so you made out with someone.
ELAINE: Well that's not sex.
GEORGE: Kissing is sex.
ELAINE: Kissing is not sex.
JERRY: George?
GEORGE: Jerry.
ELAINE: Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: George?
GEORGE: Over here.
ELAINE: What are you doing here?
JERRY: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
ELAINE: Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
JERRY: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
ELAINE: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
JERRY: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
*crash*
DICK: Merry Christmas.
ELAINE: Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
GEORGE: Hide, hide under the desk.
ELAINE: Ow, ow move over.
JERRY: Get off of me.
ELAINE: I've got no room.
(Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.)
DICK: Is that cashmere?
GEORGE: Of course it's cashmere.
DICK: (noticing the dot) What's this?
[At the comedy club]
JERRY: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
DICK: You mean on the wagon.
JERRY: Don't get smart.
[Monk's Café, the whole gang at a booth]
KRAMER: All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
ELAINE: Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
KRAMER: Well, yeah...
ELAINE: Ok, what time is your job interview George?
GEORGE: 9:45
JERRY: Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
GEORGE: What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
ELAINE: All right, I'm gonna go.
JERRY: What time is the lesbian wedding?
ELAINE: 9:30
GEORGE: Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
ELAINE: Yeah, they flip a coin.
GEORGE: What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
JERRY: I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
GEORGE: I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
KRAMER: Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
JERRY: Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
[On the Subway]
GEORGE: How many tickets are you paying today?
KRAMER: Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
GEORGE: No doors?
KRAMER: I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
(Blind violinist comes playing, with mug for the money. Everybody else gives him some change, except George)
GEORGE: I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
VIOLIN PLAYER: Thank you.
GEORGE: That guy is not blind.
JERRY: So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
GEORGE: I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
JERRY: Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
GEORGE: That's amazing.
JERRY: So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
GEORGE: What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
JERRY: All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
ELAINE: I can't. I'm the best man.
JERRY: Kramer, bumper-cars?
KRAMER: I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
JERRY: Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
SUBWAY ANNOUNCEMENT: 42th street. Change to D,N,RR,2,3,4,5,7,C,E,F train.
(They all get off and go to different directions.)
ELAINE: See'ya.
[Multiple Subway Train Intro Scenes]
(Jerry comes in and sits down. A fat man across from him gives a look.)
(George gets on another subway train. Sits next to a beautiful woman. They smile to another.)
(Kramer rushes to yet another subway and tries to find a seat. Stumbles around as all seats get filled right before him. He squeezes himself into a seat with a young obese man.)
(Jerry is falling asleep and leans towards the next guy who leaves and Jerry falls in his seat.)
[George's Train]
(Woman next to George rubs her leg and George looks at her)
WOMAN: You looking for a job?
GEORGE: Me, why?
WOMAN: Well, you're reading the classifieds.
GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
WOMAN: You didn't look like someone who needed a job.
GEORGE: Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
WOMAN: So, you're in 'the market'?
GEORGE: Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
WOMAN: Which market?
GEORGE: Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
WOMAN: So, do you work for one of those big broker-houses?
GEORGE: They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
WOMAN: Really?
GEORGE: Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
(Train horn blows and George looks back)
[Elaine's Train]
(She's carrying a wedding present. A older woman approaches her)
WOMAN: I started riding these trains in the forties. Those days a man would give up their seat for a woman. Now we're liberated and we have to stand.
ELAINE: It's ironic.
Women: What's ironic?
ELAINE: This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
WOMAN: No, I mean what does 'ironic' mean?
ELAINE: Oh...
WOMAN: Where are you up to, with such a nice present, birthday party?
ELAINE: A wedding.
Women: A wedding?
ELAINE: Yeah
WOMAN: Hah, I didn't know people still get married. It's hard today with men and women.
ELAINE: You're telling me.
WOMAN: So, are they a nice couple?
ELAINE: Oh, very nice.
WOMAN: What does he do, if you don't mind me asking?
ELAINE: She.
Women: She? She works, he doesn't. He sounds like my son.
ELAINE: There is no he.
Women: There is no he. So, who's getting married?
ELAINE: Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
Women: Lesbian wedding.
ELAINE: Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
Women (talks to man next to her): My luck. I don't talk to a soul in the subway for 35 years. I get a best man at a lesbian wedding. (leaves)
ELAINE: No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
[Kramer's train]
(A man leaves and lefts a newspaper to his seat. Kramer and another guy glance each other and rush to get the paper. The other man gets to it first and Kramer gets only little piece of one page.)
[Jerry's train]
(He is still sleeping and trying not to fall to the floor. Man across gives him a look.)
[Elaine's train
(Train is full packed)
ELAINE'S VOICE: I'm really looking forward to this. I love weddings. Maybe I'll meet somebody, umm maybe not.
(Train suddenly stops)
ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh, man. We're stopping?
[George's train]
WOMAN: Well, this is where I get off.
GEORGE: Oh, you do?
WOMAN: Eh, hey why don't you...oh nothing.
GEORGE: No, no, what, what?
WOMAN: Well, I was going to say: why don't you get off with me, but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
GEORGE: Yeah, well....
WOMAN: Yeah I knew it was a bad idea.
(George is in agony thinking if he should go or stay. Then runs after her)
GEORGE: Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
(He gets stuck between closing doors)
GEORGE: I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
[Kramer's Train]
(Kramer is reading a newspaper. Couple of men behind him are talking)
MAN1: This, it's the fourth horse of the first race, Pappanick.
MAN2: How do you know it's going to win?
MAN1: My UPS-guy tells. Guys who own the horses are regular customers. Every horse he has ever given me has won. See, they've been sandbagging and looking for a good spot. He's been getting it light cause they've been using bug boy and the workout hasn't been published. Now they are ready to run with it. They are gonna break his maiden. It's going to go to great price, maybe 30:1. I'm telling you, it's a lock.
MAN2: But it rained last night.
MAN1: Exactly, this horse loves the slop. It's in his bloodlines. His father was a mudda', his mother was a mudda'.
MAN2: His mudda' was a mudda'?
MAN1: What did I just say? Come on, let's go to the office, I'm going to call my bookie. (looks around to see if anyone is listening) Hey, don't tell anybody.
(Kramer quickly turns away)
[Jerry's Train]
(Jerry wakes up and looks to guy opposite to him. The fat guy is naked and reading a paper.)
JERRY: O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
NAKED MAN: Naked, dressed. I don't see any difference.
JERRY: You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
NAKED MAN: You got something against naked body?
JERRY: I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
NAKED MAN: Who's got time for squat thrusts?
JERRY: All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
NAKED MAN: I like a good breakfast.
JERRY: I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
NAKED MAN: I'm not ashamed of my body.
JERRY: That's your problem, you should be.
(Naked man drops half of his newspaper)
JERRY: Don't get up, please, allow me.
(Jerry picks up the paper)
[Elaine's Train]
(Elaine is still trapped in a stopped train.)
ELAINE'S VOICE: Oh, this is great. This is what I need, just what I need. Ok, take it easy I'm sure it's nothing. Probably rats on the track, we're stopping for rats. God, it's so crowded. How can there be so many people? This guy really smells, doesn't anyone use deodorant in the city? What is so hard, you take the cap off, you roll it on. What's that? I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a gage. We are in a gage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What'll they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Take it easy, it'll start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Com'on move this fu(beep) thing!! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck. Step on the gas!! What could it be? You'de think the conductor would explain it to us? 'I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes'!! I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!!
(Lights in the train go off)
[George and the woman step in to a hotel room]
GEORGE: Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
WOMAN: Make your-self comfortable.
(She steps in to bathroom.)
GEORGE'S VOICE: Make myself comfortable. What does that mean? Does she want me to take my clothes off? Is she taking her clothes off? What if I take my clothes off and she still has hers' on? Then I really look like an idiot. She could get offended and leave. So maybe I should leave them on, but what then if she takes her off? Then she'll feel humiliated. 'Make yourself comfortable'. I got this unbelievable woman and this 'comfortable'-thing can ruin me. I got it! I take my shoes off and sit on the bed. There, that's comfortable. She can't accuse me being unconvertible.
(She comes out from the bathroom, wearing a nightie.)
GEORGE: Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
[Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office. He is talking with a guy behind in the line.]
KRAMER: Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
GUY: The bug boy.
KRAMER: Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
GUY: Really? But, it's a little bit slow out there it rained last night.
KRAMER: Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
GUY: His father was a mudda'?
KRAMER: His mudda' was a mudda'.
GUY: His mudda' was a mudda'?
KRAMER: What did I just say?
(Kramer gets to the cashier)
KRAMER: Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
[Jerry's train]
NAKED MAN: They still have no pitching. Goodin's a question mahk. ...You don't recover from those rotator cuffs so fast.
JERRY: I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
NAKED MAN: No hitting? They got hitting! Bonilla, Murry. ...They got no defence.
JERRY: Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
NAKED MAN: Speed? They got Coleman. ...They need a bullpen.
JERRY: Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
NAKED MAN: They got Franco! ...What they need is a front office.
JERRY: But you gotta like their chances.
NAKED MAN: I LUV their chances.
JERRY: Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
NAKED MAN: It's a deal!
[Elaine is in a stopped train with no lights]
ELAINE'S VOICE: Why couldn't I take a cab. For 6 dollars my whole life could've changed. What is that on my leg? I'll never get out of here. What if I'm here for the rest of my life? Maybe I'll get out in 5 seconds. 1 banana, 2 banana, 3 banana, 4 banana, 5 banana...no, I'm still here! Still here! Why don't they start moving? Move! Move!! Move!!! *Train starts moving, lights get back on* It's moving! It's moving! Yes! Yes!! *Train stops again and lights go off* Motherf(beep-beep)!!!
[George and the beautiful woman are still in the hotel room. The woman is putting handcuffs on George and the other end to the backboard of the bed]
GEORGE: Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
WOMAN: Oh, don't worry. I do.
(She steps in to the bathroom)
GEORGE: You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
WOMAN: Like what?
GEORGE: Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
(She comes out of the bathroom fully clothed)
GEORGE: What's going on?
WOMAN: It was a pleasure doing business with you George, but I'm afraid I have to get going.
GEORGE: Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
WOMAN: Eight dollars? Eight dollars?
GEORGE: What are you doing? You're robbing me?
WOMAN: I wasted my whole morning with you for eight dollars?
GEORGE: Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
WOMAN: I'm taking your clothes.
GEORGE: No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
WOMAN: Bye George.
GEORGE: No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
[Kramer is in the "Off-track betting" office]
(The race is on and Pappanick is slowly making ground. Kramer is pounding himself imitating the jockey and shouts: Yes, yes, yes... The winner is Pappanick)
KRAMER: Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
(Kramer collects the winnings. A big pile of cash. Shows the money around. There is a big thug looking at the money. Kramer goes into the subway and sees that the thug followed him. He makes a run for it. Thug follows. Kramer steps out of the train and so does the thug. Kramer tries to jump back on the train, but door closes. The naked man has put his clothes back on and he and Jerry are getting of the train.)
NAKED MAN: I haven't had a hotdog at Nathan's for 20 years.
JERRY: First we ride the cyclone.
NAKED MAN: Chilly out.
(Jerry takes a deep breath)
JERRY: Aah, French fries.
[Kramer is running away from the thug and enters the train where the blind violinist is playing. Kramer knocks down the violin player and the thug picks Kramer up and looks for the money.]
THUG: Give me the money. Give me the money!
BLIND VIOLIN PLAYER: (puts a gun to the thug's head) Freeze, Police!
[Back to the Monk's café. Jerry, Kramer and Elaine are sitting in a booth]
JERRY: No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
ELAINE: Too bad.
JERRY: You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
(Waves around a stuffed monkey)
JERRY: You want him?
ELAINE: Get that out of my face.
JERRY: So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
(George enters wearing a sheet)
MAN AT THE COUNTER: (yelling) Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna!
GEORGE: How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
ELAINE: George?
JERRY: Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
GEORGE: You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
JERRY: Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
GEORGE: Give me your key, I gotta get it.
KRAMER: What happened?
GEORGE: Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
JERRY: Come on, I'll go with you.
ELAINE: Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait...
(Kramer gets the check, looks at it and gets pile of cash and pays. Jerry and Elaine look amazed)
[Jerry's Apartment]
GEORGE: ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
GEORGE: We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
(Jerry enters)
JERRY: Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
GEORGE: I was telling you about Noel.
JERRY: Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
GEORGE: [sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
JERRY: All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
GEORGE: What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
JERRY: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
GEORGE: No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
GEORGE: How do I get the hand?
JERRY: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
GEORGE: She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
JERRY: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
GEORGE: Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
GEORGE: With all due respect, I don't think so...
JERRY: That smells good, what is that?
KRAMER: The *beach*!
JERRY: The *beach*?
GEORGE: What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
KRAMER: I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
JERRY: You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
GEORGE: What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
KRAMER: Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
JERRY: Yeah... So's shock therapy.
JERRY: [with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
KRAMER: Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
GEORGE: Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
JERRY: You don't know?
GEORGE: No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
JERRY: You think they have fleas there, don't you?
GEORGE: *No*...
JERRY: Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
GEORGE: All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
ELAINE: I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
JERRY: They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
ELAINE: *No*, we would have heard it.
JERRY: What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
GEORGE: I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
JERRY: [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
(A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.)
JERRY: Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
(Noel begins. Dramatically. It's enough to make a man reach for his candy pooper. Jerry helps himself to a Pez, he stands Tweety up on Elaine's purse on her lap. Elaine valiantly tries to hold back her laughter, but it escalates from a giggle to a chortle to a chuckle to laughter to snorting. Noel is visibly shaken and she has difficulty playing with this anonymous distraction from one of the unwashed masses. Elaine removes herself from the auditorium, all the while snorting and gasping for breath, (we're talkin' full-on gales of laughter, here). Outside, she runs into an old acquaintance.)
STEVE: Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.
ELAINE: Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
STEVE: What're you doing down here?
ELAINE: Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
MOLLIKA: Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.
ELAINE: We did. We're just hanging out.
MOLLIKA: REally. ... You really look great.
ELAINE: Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
MOLLIKA: Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs. I don't know what to do for the guy.
ELAINE: Have you thought about an intervention?
MOLLIKA: What's that?
ELAINE: You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
MOLLIKA: He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.
(Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.)
[Outside Noel's dressing room]
ElainELAINE: I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!
GEORGE: What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
JERRY: I dunno, it was an impulse.
GEORGE: What kind of a sick impulse does that??
JERRY: How could I know she would start to laugh?
ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
JERRY: Can we just go in already?
GEORGE: What are we gonna tell her?
ELAINE: I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
GEORGE: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
ELAINE: [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
JERRY: What about?
GEORGE: Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
JERRY: I know, but I'm distracted now.
GEORGE: What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
ELAINE: When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
JERRY: Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
ELAINE: He's good.
GEORGE: Uh, can we cut to the chase?
JERRY: "Cut to the chase"?
GEORGE: Yeah...
JERRY: What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
GEORGE: A lot of people say it.
JERRY: I would lose that.
GEORGE: [Accusingly] What's *that*?
JERRY: "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
GEORGE: [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
JERRY: Really, an intervention ...
GEORGE: Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
ELAINE: Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
JERRY: Me? Why me?
ELAINE: 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
JERRY: Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
GEORGE: All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
JERRY: We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
ELAINE: All right.
(They Enter)
GEORGE: Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
NOEL: No..
GEORGE: Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
JERRY: You play a *Hell* of a piano.
ELAINE: Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
NOEL: Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was *humiliated...
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
NOEL: Well then, what was she laughing at?
JERRY: Pez?
NOEL: Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?
GEORGE: Me, uh, uh, no, ...
JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
NOEL: I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]
ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
GEORGE: If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
[Noel enters]
GEORGE: All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
NOEL: I don't feel like it tonight.
JERRY: We'll be outside
ELAINE: Yeah
JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
NOEL: I just crack my knuckles.
GEORGE: We'll have a good time
NOEL: I don't feel like it
GEORGE: Ah, come on
NOEL: I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!
GEORGE: Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqué. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
[MONKS]
JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
ELAINE: What? How?
JERRY: A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
ELAINE: So? What happened?
JERRY: What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
ELAINE: Shut up!
JERRY: All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
ELAINE: Whar about Kramer?
JERRY: He's the same!
[Jerry on phone at home]
JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
KRAMER: (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
KRAMER: Can I get in on that?
JERRY: What do you think? It's like a poker game?
KRAMER: Is Elaine going?
JERRY: Yeah
KRAMER: Well, I knew him as well as she did.
JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her.
KRAMER: So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
(Buzzer)
GEORGE: It's George
JERRY: Stop smelling your arm.
KRAMER: You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
KRAMER: Tell me about it!
JERRY: Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
[George enters]
GEORGE: Well it's over. It's definitely over.
JERRY: She broke up with you?
GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
JERRY: What was on the list?
GEORGE: Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
GEORGE: Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
JERRY: What's wrong with lunch?
GEORGE: Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
GEORGE: I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
KRAMER: Break up with her
GEORGE: What?
KRAMER: You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
JERRY: A preemptive breakup.
GEORGE: A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
[MONKS]
GEORGE: So, I am have to going to break up with you.
NOEL: You're breaking up with me?
GEORGE: I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
NOEL: Wow.
GEORGE: Shocked?
NOEL: I really am.
GEORGE: Never expected this did you?
NOEL: I thought everything was fine.
GEORGE: Well, live and learn.
NOEL: I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?
GEORGE: Kind of.
NOEL: I'm very confused.
GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
NOEL: I thought,...
GEORGE: Now, stop it ...
NOEL: What do you want, I can make you happy.
GEORGE: When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
NOEL: I don't know.
GEORGE: This is what I'm talking about.
NOEL: OK, I'll think about you.
GEORGE: All the time.
NOEL: All the time? ... OK, All the time.
GEORGE: I can't hear you.
NOEL: All the time. ALL THE TIME.
GEORGE: See, It's not so hard.
[CALVIN KLEIN]
KRAMER: Go ahead smell, smell
STEVE: Yeah, so?
KRAMER: Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
STEVE: What are you talking about?
KRAMER: Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
STEVE: What about it?
KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
STEVE: That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
KRAMER: Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
STEVE: Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.
KRAMER: So you don't think it's a good idea?
[The Intervention [NOTE:DOUBLE CHECK THIS PART FOR SURE!!!!]
(To Elaine)
GUY: The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a kid so I have to stick tissue up there
ELAINE: (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
GUY: Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.
(To Jerry)
OTHER GUY: Are there any ice cubes?
JERRY: In the freezer.
OTHER GUY: I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.
JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
OTHER GUY: I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)
GUY: Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?
STEVE: What's the plan?
JERRY: Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
OTHER GUY: Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.
GUY: No, we all have to talk.
ELAINE: What's the order?
GUY: We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.
ROBERTA: Why am I first?
ELAINE: Albano is your last name.
ROBERTA: That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.
STEVE: I'll go first.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Is this the interference?
JERRY: Intervention.
OTHER GUY: What are you doing here?
KRAMER: Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
STEVE: Hey, this is for close friends only.
KRAMER: I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
OTHER GUY: Let him stay.
KRAMER: Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
STEVE: Somebody's going to make that crap?
(Some old guys enter)
OLD GUY: Kramer!
KRAMER: Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
OTHER GUY: They can't stay.
OLD GUY: We're having a party here?
JERRY: No, we're having an intervention
OLD GUY: An intervention? Who's intervening?
JERRY: There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
OLD GUY: Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped coming. We would go to his house and say, "What you don't want to be a polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?"
(Buzzer)
GUY: It's him.
ROBERTA: What should we do?
ELAINE: Hide!
JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
GEORGE: It's George
JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
GUY: If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.
ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
GUY: Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
ELAINE: You're getting warm.
(George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful)
GEORGE: We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.
GEORGE: Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?
JERRY: Well, uh..
NOEL: (happily) Elaine, hi.
ELAINE: Oh, hi Noel
(Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them)
JERRY: Well, you're looking well.
GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man." I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.
STEVE: Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.
GEORGE: (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
STEVE: You think so?
GEORGE: I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you
OLD MAN: The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.
ELAINE: (Chuckles)
Old GUY; at least give me a pocket.
ELAINE: (laughs)
(Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven)
NOEL: That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.
ELAINE: No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
(Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg)
NOEL: You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.
JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.
NOEL: You lied to me George, you lied to me.
GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?
NOEL: I ... am breaking up ... with you!
GEORGE: You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
NOEL: And you're going to need it.
(Noel exits, George chases her)
(Richie and John enter)
JERRY: Hey Richie
RICHIE: So what's going on?
(Later)
JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
GEORGE: I can't do these puzzles.
JERRY: So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
GEORGE: Ah ah Pez dispenser.
JERRY: He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
GEORGE: Well they're hard to load.
JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
GEORGE: Poor kid.
JERRY: So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
GEORGE: What did you do?
JERRY: What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
GEORGE: Wow
JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
GEORGE: What's a three letter word for candy?
JERRY: I can't do those things.
[Opening Monologue]
The thing I don't understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don't die and that's it. They stop trying. Why? Why don't they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it's worse because now they've found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that's why these people don't succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don't work, try a rope. Car won't start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There's nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.
[Jerry's Apartment]
JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
ELAINE: Na.
JERRY: What are you doing? We're going out for dinner in ten minutes.
ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
(buzzer)
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: It's George.
JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You've got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
ELAINE: I don't know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
JERRY: I think I'll take out the garbage.
ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?
JERRY: Well, once I didn't have dinner until, like 9:00 o'clock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage – meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya'? Throw out my garbage for me.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Come on, it's just down the hall.
GEORGE: Give me two bucks. I'll do it for two bucks.
JERRY: I'll give you 50 cents.
GEORGE: There's no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drake's coffee cake
GEORGE: You're not getting no Drake's Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.
JERRY: I don't get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
GEORGE: It's an incredible deal. I don't know why you don't come with me.
JERRY: Nah, I don't go for these non-refundable deals. I can't commit to a woman. I'm not going to commit to an airline.
(Gina enters the hall)
GINA: Hi.
JERRY: Hi.
GINA: How are you?
JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake's Coffee Cake is?
GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
JERRY: How much do they cost?
GINA: The junior?
GEORGE: No, no the full size.
JERRY: No, no the junior.
GEORGE: You didn't say "junior".
GINA: I haven't had one of those since I was a little girl.
JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya' doing?
MARTIN: Good enough.
(MARTIN leaves with Gina)
JERRY: Boy she's sexy isn't she?
(Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer's apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry's apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.)
JERRY: Do you believe that guy?
ELAINE: What guy?
JERRY: My neighbour:
ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?
JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
GEORGE: He didn't seem too pleased.
ELAINE: Maybe I'll get a steak with french fried onion wings.
GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
JERRY: What's so amazing? You've seen him before.
GEORGE: I haven't seen him for months.
JERRY: What was the dream?
GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
JERRY: I think I've played there.
GEORGE: I've had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
JERRY: You're a little paranormal
ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
GEORGE: Really?
ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.
GEORGE: I'd love to go. Make an appointment.
JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
GEORGE: I just got fired.
JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
(They exit)
[Jerry's apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]
JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?
GINA: It's Gina.
JERRY: Who?
GINA: Martine's girl friend.
JERRY: Martine?
GINA: You next door neighbour.
JERRY: Oh, Martin!
(Jerry opens door)
GEORGE: It's Martine. I think he's dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
JERRY: What?
GINA: Come on.
JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
GINA: We don't have enough time.
JERRY: It'll take two seconds.
GINA: There is no time.
JERRY: We don't have two seconds?
GINA: All right. Go ahead.
JERRY: Nah, forget it.
GINA: No, go ahead.
JERRY: Nah. I'll just wear the pajamas.
GINA: Will you just get it.
JERRY: Are you sure?
GINA: Forget it. Come on.
JERRY: Nah, I'll go get the robe.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center]
JERRY: That's not too bad. It's not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.
JERRY: Really? It's over?
GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man's hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake's Coffee Cake.
JERRY: He said that?
GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How it's too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.
JERRY: I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
GINA: I wasn't.
JERRY: You weren't?
GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?
JERRY: Of course.
GINA: Tell me everything.
JERRY: Are you sure he can't hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.
JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they're going to look at a thing like this.
GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
GINA: Are you afraid of him?
JERRY: No.
GINA: Then kiss me.
JERRY: Here?
GINA: Yes, right here.
JERRY: Is this the proper venue?
GINA: You don't want to?
JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.
JERRY: I can't. What if he wakes up?
GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and you're afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?
JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy's got a coma going like this … you don't want to mess with it.
[Jerry's apartment]
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?
JERRY: Yeah, I heard.
KRAMER: I can't believe he's in a coma.
KRAMER: He's got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
JERRY: Who told you about Martin?
KRAMER: Newman! He's good friends with him.
JERR: Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
KRAMER: He's got all of my attachments, you know.
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
JERRY: You know I don't get that whole suicide machine. There's no tall buildings where these people live? They can't wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
KRAMER: So what's going on between you and Gina?
JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
KRAMER: Uh, uh.
JERRY: So we're in the room and she's trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see that's the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
JERRY: Nothing.
KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don't have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
JERRY: I didn't know what the coma etiquette was.
KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see that's the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn't matter what you do around it.
JERRY: So you're saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it's all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
KRAMER: I'd give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can't get out of it in 24 hours, it's a land rush.
JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he's thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there's nothing left?
KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! That's why I'm trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody's going to grab it.
[The psychic's apartment]
RULA: Martin's spirit came to you as a warning.
ELAINE: Why would he come to George?
RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.
GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.
RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?
GEORGE: Drakes?
RULA: Yes.
GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?
RULA: No, why?
GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.
RULA: Maybe I did.
ELAINE: Take it away.
GEORGE: She hasn't eaten in two days.
RULA: Who's Pauline?
GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
RULA: Do you think about her?
GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.
RULA: Cut these with your left hand.
GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
RULA: Not in this life.
ELAINE: Should you be smoking?
RULA: Does it bother you?
ELAINE: You're pregnant.
GEORGE: Elaine.
RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.
RULA: Ah oh.
GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
RULA: I don't know about this trip George.
GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
ELAINE: It's really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
GEORGE: Elaine, she's a psychic. She knows how the kid's going to be.
GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?
RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.
ELAINE: Now listen. I just don't know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?
ELAINE: It's disgusting.
RULA: I DON'T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.
ELAINE: Oh fine, I don't like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
RULA: Get the hell out.
(Elaine leaving)
GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.
GEORGE: If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.
RULA: Get out.
GEORGE: Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
[Jerry's apartment]
GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth (kisses Kerry). Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?
JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?
JERRY: They're a comedy team.
GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.
JERRY: Well, they're three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
GINA: You will show me The Stooges?
JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.
GINA: When?
JERRY: Well, I don't really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.
JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I don't want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it's not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
GINA: You're still afraid. You are not a man.
JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.
(Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman)
KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.
NEWMAN: I can't eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
KRAMER: ???
NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]
JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn't hurt me.
ELAINE: (jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
JERRY: Boy, it's a good thing we came.
GEORGE: Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there's native unrest.
ELAINE: Hi, I haven't eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
NURSE: We'll call you.
JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If I'm ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
GEORGE: How come?
JERRY: Looters.
ELAINE: How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
JERRY: She's really hungry.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey.
ELAINE: Kramer
KRAMER: Well, Newman's upstairs visiting Martin.
GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
KRAMER: You're not going?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: Why not?
GEORGE: The psychic said something terrible will happen.
KRAMER: I dig.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martin's room]
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she's going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she's going to kill me.
NEWMAN: He can't hear you, you idiot. Why don't you just buy another one.
KRAMER: Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
NEWMAN: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
KRAMER: I don't want a carpet sweeper. They don't do anything.
NEWMAN: It gets my rug clean.
KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
NEWMAN: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
KRAMER: I wouldn't set foot in your house.
(Jerry enters)
JERRY: Hello.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
JERRY: How's he doing?
KRAMER: He looks happy to me.
NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
JERRY: Why wouldn't he?
NEWMAN: No reason.
JERRY: He'll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
NEWMAN: I'll bring him up to date.
JERRY: How up to date?
NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.
JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?
NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.
KRAMER: Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He's not going.
NEWMAN: I don't care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..
JERRY: Drake's Coffee Cake
NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?
JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.
NEWMAN: Boy, that's the full size.
JERRY: That's your big boy.
NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?
JERRY: I don't give out bites. I got another one. But I'm saving it for later.
NEWMAN: Just one bite?
JERRY: I don't think so. You know they, they're so fragile.
NEWMAN: All right! All right. I won't say anything.
JERRY: You swear?
NEWMAN: I swear.
JERRY: On your mother's life?
NEWMAN: On my mother's life.
KRAMER: oh oh oh oh oh
NEWMAN: Oooh,
[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]
ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
(George sees the Psychic's girl, Faisy and follows her into the Psychic's room))
GEORGE: …sweetheart, no come here, … sweetheart
RULA: pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)
GEORGE: how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
RULA: The nurse said she would be right back. They're supposed to take me into the delivery room.
GEORGE: Oh, that's great. That's great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don't even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn't get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
RULA: Oh, where's the nurse
GEORGE: I don't know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don't you get a nurse for mommy? … Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
RULA: Don't take that trip.
GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?
RULA: (screams) EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.
(Doctor enters)
Dx: All right, Rula, it's time to go.
GEORGE: Because? Because?
(Elaine enters Martins room)
ELAINE: Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! … Drake's Coffee Cake? … Give me that.
NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell.
JERRY: Elaine! No! No!
MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,
(In hallway as they wheel Rula to give birth)
GEORGE: Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
(Martin's room – Martin grabbing Jerry – Elaine eating the Drake's Coffee Cake)
NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!
JERRY: Hey!
NEWMAN: It was disgusting.
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: What are you doing? We're going out to dinner in ten minutes.
GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. It's really quite disgusting.
JERRY: What did she name the kid?
GEORGE: You wouldn't believe it. Rasputin.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Heey!
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: when did you get back?
KRAMER: A couple of hours ago.
GEORGE: So how was it?
KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
JERRY: osh.
KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
JERRY: Woah. (hitting George)
KRAMER: Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
JERRY: Wow! (hitting George)
KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
JERRY: Oh! (hitting George)
KRAMER: We played Backgammon in the nude.
JERRY: Oh! (hitting George)
KRAMER: She's a sweet kid.
JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
KRAMER: Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That's probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta' watch for the jellyfish.
KRAMER: Yeah.
KRAMER: What's this?
JERRY: Oh, it's an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
KRAMER: They moved in together?
JERRY: Yeah, it's some place down in the village.
KRAMER: Phew.
(buzzer)
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
JERRY: All right we're coming down.
KRAMER: Hey, where ya' going?
JERRY: We're taking Elaine to dinner. She's got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
KRAMER: Um, I'd like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we'll be getting together.
GEORGE: Elle McPherson going to be there?
KRAMER: OH! I got to call her back.
(Kramer exits)
[Opening monologue]
Well have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time and a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now you are playing God. Of course God was the first person to fix people up. Fixed up Adam and Eve. Ya know I'm sure he said to Adam, "No she's nice ah..she's a..she's a.. yeah she's very free about here body doesn't really wear much and ah she was going out with a snake. I think that's over though."
[Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.]
GEORGE: Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
JERRY: Oh, yes you will.
GEORGE: No, I won't.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe you won't.
GEORGE: I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
JERRY: Are my nostrils getting bigger?
GEORGE: No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?
(Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi' which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)
[Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.]
CYNTHIA: There's just no men out there, you know?
ELAINE: I know.
CYNTHIA: I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves to one person.
ELAINE: I hate the good ones.
CYNTHIA: Is Jerry one of the good ones?
ELAINE: That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
CYNTHIA: Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're right."
ELAINE: You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
CYNTHIA: No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
[Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.]
GEORGE: I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
JERRY: Oh, so there's still hope.
GEORGE: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
JERRY: Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
GEORGE: It's my only hope.
[Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.]
CYNTHIA: See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother. I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.
ELAINE: Well, at least you're not bitter.
CYNTHIA: Who says I'm not bitter?
ELAINE: Aren't you too young to be bitter?
CYNTHIA: No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.
ELAINE: Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
CYNTHIA: Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.
[Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
ELAINE: So what'd you do last night?
JERRY: Went out with George, you?
ELAINE: Went out with Cynthia.
JERRY: How was it? What'd you talk about?
ELAINE: Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
JERRY: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
ELAINE: I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
JERRY: George too.
(They look at each other for a moment.)
JERRY AND ELAINE (together): Yeah, right.
JERRY: I've never fixed anybody up.
ELAINE: Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
JERRY: Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
ELAINE: I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
JERRY: Well you implied it.
ELAINE: I didn't say it.
JERRY: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
ELAINE: Who is he?
JERRY: He's George!
ELAINE: She's Cynthia!
JERRY: So what?
ELAINE: What, you don't think she's beautiful?
JERRY: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
ELAINE: You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
JERRY: I went out with you.
ELAINE: That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
JERRY: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
ELAINE: He can really do that?
JERRY: Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
ELAINE: What, are you into this?
JERRY: Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
ELAINE: No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
JERRY: Naturally.
ELAINE: Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
JERRY: Everything.
ELAINE: What if it worked out?
JERRY (dialing): Yeah right.
[Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: Out of the question. Out of the question!
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
JERRY: She's good looking.
GEORGE: How good looking?
JERRY: Very good looking.
GEORGE: Really good looking?
JERRY: Really very good looking.
GEORGE: Would you take her out?
JERRY: Yes, I would take her out.
GEORGE: Oh, you hesitated.
JERRY: What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
GEORGE: No, something's off here, you hesitated.
JERRY: I'm telling you, she's good looking.
GEORGE: What about the body, what kind of body?
JERRY: Good body, nice body.
GEORGE: How nice?
JERRY: Nice.
GEORGE: Just nice?
JERRY: Pretty nice.
GEORGE: Really good?
JERRY: Really very nice and good.
GEORGE: What about personality?
JERRY: Good personality. Funny. Bright.
GEORGE: Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
JERRY: How could she be smarter than you?
GEORGE: Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
[Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.]
CYNTHIA: First of all, what does he do?
ELAINE: He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
CYNTHIA: He's not working?! How come he's not working?
ELAINE: Well, um, he, he got fired.
CYNTHIA: Why did he get fired?
ELAINE: Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
CYNTHIA: Excuse me?
ELAINE: Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
CYNTHIA: Is he nuts?
ELAINE: No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
CYNTHIA: What does he look like?
ELAINE: Pardon?
CYNTHIA: What does he look like?
ELAINE: Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
CYNTHIA: Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?
ELAINE: Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
CYNTHIA: He's bald?
ELAINE: No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
CYNTHIA: So he will be bald.
ELAINE: Yup.
[Cut back to Jerry and George.]
GEORGE: What kind of hair?
JERRY: You know, long dark hair.
GEORGE: Flowing?
JERRY: Flowing?
GEORGE: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
JERRY: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
GEORGE: Yeah, that's right.
JERRY: Just clarifying.
GEORGE: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
JERRY: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
GEORGE: I'd like to be able to get it out.
JERRY: I think you'll get it out.
GEORGE: What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
JERRY: She's got a fine cheek.
GEORGE: Is there a pinkish hue?
JERRY: A pinkish hue?
GEORGE: Yes, a rosy glow.
JERRY: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
GEORGE: Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
JERRY: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
[Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia]
CYNTHIA: Has he ever been married?
ELAINE: No.
CYNTHIA: Has he been close?
ELAINE: He once spent a weekend with a woman.
CYNTHIA: He didn't really try to poison his boss?
ELAINE: Yeah, he did.
[The next day, George is back at Jerry's]
GEORGE: We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
JERRY: I think it's tamber.
GEORGE: Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
JERRY: I didn't notice the voice.
GEORGE: It's mellifluous!
JERRY: So, Saturday night.
GEORGE: She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Hi.
GEORGE: Hey! Saturday night!
ELAINE: I know!
GEORGE: So, what did she say?
ELAINE: She said you're getting together Saturday night!
GEORGE: That's it?
ELAINE: Yeah!
GEORGE: She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
ELAINE: No.
GEORGE: Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: She could have mentioned the conversation.
GEORGE: Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
JERRY: Oh, the guy from Jersey?
KRAMER: Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
GEORGE: What are you gonna do with all of them?
KRAMER: Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
JERRY: No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
KRAMER: Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
ELAINE: Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.
GEORGE: I'll take one. It's possible.
[Mid-episode monologue]
The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" (nods) "Have a nice day." "You too."
[Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.]
JERRY: So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
ELAINE: I think they went out to dinner.
JERRY: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
GEORGE: Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
JERRY: Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.
JERRY: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
ELAINE: Remember our pact. Full disclosure.
JERRY: Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
GEORGE: Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
JERRY: You can tell me, I'll vault it.
GEORGE: It's in the vault?
JERRY: I'm locking the vault. What?
GEORGE: We had sex.
JERRY: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
GEORGE: I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
JERRY: At your apartment?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: She didn't stay over?
GEORGE: No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
[Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.]
ELAINE: Oh my god.
CYNTHIA: He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.
ELAINE: So? How was it?
CYNTHIA: How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.
ELAINE: Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.
CYNTHIA: Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.
ELAINE: Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?
JERRY: So, what did she have to say?
ELAINE: What did he have to say?
JERRY: He said they had a good time.
ELAINE: Her too.
JERRY: Oh, good.
ELAINE: Anything else?
JERRY: Nope. You?
ELAINE: Nope.
JERRY: You sure?
ELAINE: Yup. You?
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.
JERRY: Yeah. Okay then.
ELAINE: Alright. Goodnight.
JERRY: Goodnight.
[Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
JERRY: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
GEORGE: What are you gonna do?
JERRY: Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
GEORGE: I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
JERRY: I'm gonna call her.
GEORGE: No, don't call her.
JERRY: No, I'm calling her.
GEORGE: No, Jerry, don't call.
JERRY: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
GEORGE: I don't want you to call.
JERRY: Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
GEORGE: Give me the phone!
JERRY: George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
GEORGE: Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.
KRAMER: Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
JERRY: I'll just call her when you leave!
GEORGE: You can't do that, it's none of your business!
JERRY: It is so my business!
KRAMER: Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
GEORGE: But tell him to give me the--
KRAMER: Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: Yeah, but--
KRAMER: Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
JERRY: But Kramer--
KRAMER: Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
(Jerry and George shake hands)
KRAMER: Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
GEORGE: What?
KRAMER: Right.
GEORGE: Defective?!
KRAMER: Defective.
GEORGE: (attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
KRAMER: I didn't even know they were defective.
(Jerry gets between them to break up the fight)
KRAMER: Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
GEORGE: What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
JERRY: Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
[Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia]
CYNTHIA: I missed my period.
ELAINE: Oh my god.
CYNTHIA: I am very worried, I am never late.
ELAINE: But he used a condom, right?
CYNTHIA: I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.
ELAINE: Oh no.
CYNTHIA: What?
ELAINE: Was it blue?
CYNTHIA: Yeah. How'd you know?
ELAINE: Just a hunch.
[Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.]
JERRY: Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
(Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.)
JERRY: Oh, hi. Soda?
ELAINE: No thanks.
JERRY: So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
ELAINE: Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
JERRY: Oh, I know her. I know her type.
ELAINE: Her type? What type?
JERRY: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
ELAINE: You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
JERRY: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
ELAINE: She's not bitter!
JERRY: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
ELAINE: Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
JERRY: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
ELAINE: Are you calling me a liar?
JERRY: I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
ELAINE: Are you?
JERRY: Get your finger out of my face.
ELAINE: You get yours out, I was here first!
JERRY: I don't care.
ELAINE: Get it out!
(Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets in the middle.)
KRAMER: Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
ELAINE: I knew those condoms were defective!
JERRY: How did you know they were defective?!
(George walks in.)
ELAINE: Because! Because she missed her period!
GEORGE: She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
(George rushes out, hysterical.)
[Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant]
CYNTHIA: So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.
ELAINE: Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.
CYNTHIA: I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period." And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--
(George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.)
ELAINE: Hi!
GEORGE: Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
ELAINE: What happened?
JERRY: Acting.
ELAINE: Very mature.
JERRY: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
CYNTHIA: Hi.
JERRY: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
CYNTHIA: Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the kitchen.
GEORGE: (hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
JERRY: So what are these?
ELAINE: Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.
(George starts eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the idea that the relationship has just ended.)
GEORGE: (with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
[Closing monologue]
Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed up Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. She's very free about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with a snake, I think that's over though."
[Opening Monologue]
To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.
[Gym Locker Room]
KRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
GEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.
JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
JERRY: You chuck.
GEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?
KRAMER: You're a chucker.
GEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
KRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.
KRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
JERRY: No, did you?
KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?
GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
JERRY: All right
KRAMER: Have a good one.
JERRY: All right
GEORGE: See ya.
(Kramer exits)
GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?
JERRY: You know who that is? That's
GEORGE: Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?
JERRY: Yeah, that's him.
GEORGE: Are you sure?
JERRY: Positive.
GEORGE: Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.
JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff
JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
GEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension
JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.
JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
GEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.
JERRY: So?
GEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball player Jerry, Baseball!
JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
GEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo. The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.
KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.
JERRY: Really?
KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do.
JERRY: What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
GEORGE: Mine too.
KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson
JERRY: Thank you.
GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
KEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?
JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
GEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.
JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee
JERRY: Oh. that would be great.
GEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.
KEITH: Who's this chucker?
[Monks]
JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.
ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.
JERRY: I can't ... I can't
ELAINE: Why not?
JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
ELAINE: What's the difference?
JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
ELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
ELAINE: I'm sorry honey.
JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
ELAINE: No,
JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
ELAINE: I know.
JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
ELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
ELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
JERRY: For what dinner?
ELAINE: Dinner's good.
JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
ELAINE: Jerry, He's A GUY!
JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.
[Middle Monologue]
When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food. They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid, you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend, they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!
[New York State Department of Labor]
MRS. SOKOL: You know you only have two more weeks before your benefits run out.

MRS. SOKOL: So where have you been looking for work?
GEORGE: Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.

[Jerry's Apartment]
KRAMER: Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
JERRY: Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
ELAINE: Who are they?
JERRY: Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
JERRY: (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
ELAINE: You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore then you wouldn't have to see it.
JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
ELAINE: yeah ha ha ha
JERRY: Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
KRAMER: (does a double take) It's too busy
ELAINE: It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him. You're not being yourself.
KRAMER: What guy?
JERRY: I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
KRAMER: Who are you talkin about?
JERRY: Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
KRAMER: KEITH HERNANDEZ?
NEWMAN: (enters) KEITH HERNANDEZ?
[In cab]
GEORGE: Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta this lane. You gotta get out of this lane. This lane stinks. They're all double parked here Please get outta this lane. I'm beggin you please please.
(changes lanes)
GEORGE: You know what, bad mistake my mistake do me a favor go back to the other lane - you'll never get there - forget this lane - y'a kn ow what this lane stinks - go back to the other lane - bad decision - go go go take this light - take this light -
CABBY: That's it GET OUT!!
GEORGE: Get out?
CABBY: Get out of my cab.
GEORGE: Wa, I'm not getting out of this cab
(Cabby gets out)
GEORGE: No, no! You can't throw me out
(Wrestling in cab)
[Jerry's Apartment]
JERRY: Hellooo Newman.
KRAMER: I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
NEWMAN: I despise him.
ELAINE: Why?
NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...
KRAMER: Let me tell it ..
NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..
KRAMER: You always tell it ..
NEWMAN: All right, tell it.
KRAMER: Ja ja ja - just tell it
NEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies ninth. Cost the Mets the game.
KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and profound way front that day forward.
ELAINE: What was it?
KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.
ELAINE: Wow! What a story.
JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
[THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM; SCENE IN
THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!]
NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.
JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?
KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
JERRY: Again
KRAMER: Back and to the left
JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left
ELAINE: So, what are you saying?
JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
ELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.
JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.
NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. (Exits)
KRAMER: Wait, wait, (Exits)
JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
(George runs in)
GEORGE: (Frantically) Did anybody call here asking for Vandelay industries?
JERRY: No. What happened to you?
GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close to getting a job with Vandelay Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone rings you've got to answer "Vandelay Industries".
JERRY: I'm Vandelay Industries?
GEORGE: Right.
JERRY: And what is that?
GEORGE: You're in latex
JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?
GEORGE: Ya manufacture it.
ELAINE: Here in this little apartment?
JERRY: And what do I say about you?
GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.
JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
GEORGE: Right.
JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?
GEORGE: Because I asked you to.
JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
(Buzzer)
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: It's Keith.
JERRY: All right we're coming down.
GEORGE: KEITH HERNANDEZ:?
JERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
GEORGE: Where are you goin?
ELAINE: He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter. But who was it? Who had the motive?
JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
GEORGE: What the hell are you two talking about? (All exit)

GEORGE: You, uh, you like baseball? [picks up baseball from desk]
MRS. SOKOL: That was autographed by the '86 Mets. I saw every inning that year.
GEORGE: Funny, cause I happen to be very good friends with Keith Hernandez.
MRS. SOKOL: You know Keith Hernandez.
GEORGE: Know him? Would you, uh, like to meet him?
MRS. SOKOL: Oh, come on. Come on.
GEORGE: I can produce Keith Hernandez right here within the hour.
MRS. SOKOL: All right. You got ONE hour.
GEORGE: All right Mrs. S. I and my good pal Keith Hernandez will be right back.
(George slowly leave the office then takes off down the hallway)
[Same phone booth as part one]
(George sees large construction worker in booth and leaves. he hops into a cab)
GEORGE: 129 west 81st street and hurry.
(same cabby as part one; stares at him)
GEORGE: Goodbye (exits cab)
[Jerry's Apartment]
KEITH: Better bring your gloves, it's freezing out there. It shouldn't take too long. I'd say maybe, oh, four hours. Really though, Jerry, there's not that much. First we got the bedroom, we got two dressers and the bed.
JERRY: Is there a box spring?
KEITH: What's that?
JERRY: Is there a box spring?
KEITH: Yeah there's a box spring but it's attached to the headboard and we'll have to take that apart. Then we got the couch.
JERRY: Is that a sectional?
KEITH: Yeah. Twelve pieces. <not clear> …coffee table.
JERRY: Is that a thick marble?
[… Jerry and Keith start to laugh and Jerry walks behind Keith so they don't make eye
contact and break up]
KEITH: Three inches thick. Got it in Italy. But the BIG problem is going to be the convertible sofa. You see when you move it it tends to open up so it's going to be real difficult getting it down the stairs.
JERRY: STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
KEITH: Nah, it's a brownstone. Three floors.
JERRY: I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
(Kramer enters, sees Keith and does a double take)
KRAMER: Hello.
KEITH: Hello.
KRAMER: Oh, you don't remember me.
KEITH: No should I [continuity error: in fact he SHOULD from the basketball game]
KRAMER: Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
(Newman enters)
NEWMAN: June 14th, 1987. Mets Phillies. You made a big error. Cost the Mets the game. Then you're coming up the parking lot ramp.
KEITH: YOU said, "Nice game, pretty boy."
KRAMER: Ah, you remember.
NEWMAN: And then you spit on us.
KEITH: Hey, I didn't spit at you.
NEWMAN: Oh, yeah, right.
KRAMER: No no no, well, then who was it?
KEITH: Well lookit, the way I remember it (back to the grainy 8mm film parody) I was walking up the ramp. I was upset about the game. That's when you called me pretty boy. It ticked me off. I started to turn around to say something and as I turned around I saw Roger McDowell behind the bushes over by that gravely road. … Anyway he was talking to someone and they were talking to you. I tried to scream out but it was too late. It was already on its way.
JERRY: I told you!
NEWMAN: Wow, it was McDowell.
JERRY: But why? Why McDowell?
KRAMER: Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
NEWMAN: He must have caught a glimpse of us when I poured that beer on his head.
NEWMAN: It was McDowell.
KRAMER: Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
NEWMAN: Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier. I uh.
KEITH: look guys, don't worry about it, I uh, Well I guess I better get going.
KRAMER: Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
KEITH: I gotta move.
KRAMER: Want any help?
KEITH: I'd love some.
KRAMER: I'd love to help you move.
NEWMAN: Me too.
KEITH: Ok guys, we gotta be careful of one thing. Some of the stuff's very fragile We're going to have to handle it like a baby.
KRAMER: No sweat.
(Kramer and Newman exit)
(phone rings)
JERRY: Hello, … oh hi Elaine .. what's going on … no he just left … you broke up with him? … ME TOO .. what happened? … oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope … me … nah … I couldn't go through with it … I just didn't feel ready … so what are you doing now? … Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
(George frantically enters)
GEORGE: Keith, Keith Wa What happened? Where's Keith?
JERRY: You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
GEORGE: (out the window) Keith, Keith, up here. Can you do me a favor? I need you to go to the unemployment office with me. I, I'm Jerry's friend … the guy from the locker room, … I'm the chucker. It'll take five minutes. Wait. Wait.
(sits down)
JERRY: Well Biff/ What's next?
GEORGE: I don't know.
(Tall girl enters)
TALL GIRL: Excuse me. I was walking behind you and you dropped your wallet.
[Ending Monologue]
When You're moving your whole world becomes boxes. That's all you think about is boxes. Boxes, where are there boxes? You just wander down the street going in and out of stores. Are there boxes here? Have you seen any boxes? I mean it's all you think about. You can't even talk to people because you can't concentrate. Shut up I'm looking for boxes. Just after a while you become like really into it you can smell them. You walk into a store. There's boxes here. Don't tell me you don't have boxes. Dammit, I can SMELL them. I'm like I'm obsessed. I love the smell of cardboard in the morning. You could be at a funeral. Everyone's mourning crying around, and your looking at the casket. That's a nice box Does anyone know where that guy got that box? When he's done with it do you think I could get that? it's got some nice handles on it. And that's what death is really. It's the last big move of your life. The hearse is like the van. The pale bearers are your close friends the only ones you could ask to help you with a big move like that. and the casket is that great perfect box you've been waiting for your whole life The only problem is, once you find it you're in it.
[Opening Monologue]
Do you think that the people at the airport that run the stores have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world? Or do you think they just feel they have their own little country out there and they can charge anything they want? You're hungry? Tuna sandwich is nine dollars. You don't like it; go back to your own country. I think the whole airport airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches. I think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry. I mean think about it; the terminals, the airplanes, it's all just a distraction so that you don't notice the beating that you're taking on the tuna.
[George is at the airport]
GEORGE: It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?
(The woman walks away. George addresses the man standing on the other side.)
GEORGE: Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?
MAN: There's a clock over there.
GEORGE: Where?
MAN: (pointing) There.
GEORGE: But you have a watch on.
MAN: It's right by the escalator.
GEORGE: Why don't you just look at your watch?
MAN: I told you, it's right over there.
GEORGE: Let me see the watch.
(George grabs the man's wrist.)
MAN: Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!
GEORGE: You know we're living in a society!
(Jerry walks up from the ramp.)
JERRY: George.
GEORGE: Jerry. Jerry.
JERRY: Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
GEORGE: I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
JERRY: Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
GEORGE: One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
JERRY: So you have no car?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: So what good are you?
Jerry looks over towards a chauffer holding a sign that says O'BRIEN
JERRY: I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
GEORGE: How do you know?
JERRY: He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
GEORGE: We should take his limo.
JERRY: Yeah, right.
GEORGE: Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
JERRY: He's definitely in Chicago.
GEORGE: Well the guy's just standing there.
JERRY: How would we do it?
GEORGE: We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
JERRY: Maybe he knows O'Brien?
GEORGE: No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
JERRY: What if we get caught?
GEORGE: What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
JERRY: Who's gonna be O'Brien?
GEORGE: I'll be O'Brien.
JERRY: Who am I?
GEORGE: You're you.
JERRY: Just me?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: Okay.
GEORGE: What, you don't want to be you?
JERRY: Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
GEORGE: Like who?
JERRY: Dylan Murphy.
(George mumbles something.)
JERRY: What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
GEORGE: Well I like Dylan.
JERRY: You could be Colin.
GEORGE: Colin O'Brien.
JERRY: I'm Dylan Murphy.
GEORGE: I'm Colin O'Brien.
(They walk towards the chauffeur.)
GEORGE: Are we really doing this?
JERRY: Come on,
MAN: (to George) Hey, do you have the time?
GEORGE: Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
CHAUFFEUR: Yes sir.
GEORGE: Sorry we're late.
CHAUFFEUR: Here let me take that for you.
GEORGE: Oh thank you.
CHAUFFEUR: I'll get the car and I'll bring it around front.
GEORGE: Thank you very much. Dylan?
JERRY: Colin?
[George and Jerry are in the back of a limo. George is giddy with excitement.]
GEORGE: This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
JERRY: What for?
GEORGE: I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
JERRY: She happy for you?
GEORGE: Can he hear us?
JERRY: No. Why?
GEORGE: I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
JERRY: He can't hear us.
GEORGE: Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
JERRY: Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
GEORGE: We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
CHAUFFEUR: Madison Square Garden, of course. I have the four passes.
GEORGE: Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
JERRY: We're going to the Knick game!
GEORGE: Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
JERRY: I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
GEORGE: You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
JERRY: Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
GEORGE: If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
JERRY: Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
CHAUFFEUR: I know.
Jerry and GEORGE: He knows?
GEORGE: Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
JERRY: Maybe it's a shortcut.
GEORGE: We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
JERRY: (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
CHAUFFEUR: Pick up the other members of your party.
GEORGE: Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
JERRY: It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
GEORGE: It was a good jig.
JERRY: It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
GEORGE: There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
JERRY: First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
GEORGE: Well you should have been O'Brien.
JERRY: I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
GEORGE: Yes, you have to be Murphy.
JERRY: It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
GEORGE: You're Murphy!
JERRY: I'm Seinfeld!
GEORGE: You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
JERRY: We're doing sixty miles an hour!
GEORGE: So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
JERRY: Who are you, Mannix?
GEORGE: We're slowing down. Are those the people?
JERRY: Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
(The limo pulls over, two people, a man (Tim) and a woman (Eva), get in.)
WOMAN: (reaches out to Jerry) Mr. O'Brien?
JERRY: No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
EVA: (whispering) Oh, well I don't want to disturb him. We're just rather excited to meet him face to face, finally. We're faithful readers of his newsletter.
JERRY: Newsletter?
TIM: And of course, his great book, "The Game".
JERRY: Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
EVA: No.
JERRY: Never seen a picture of him?
EVA: Never.
JERRY: Not even on the book jacket?
EVA: There was no picture on the book jacket.
JERRY: (nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
GEORGE: Hello. I'm O'Brien.
[Elaine meets Kramer of Jerry's corner.]
KRAMER: Hey!
ELAINE: Hey!
KRAMER: What, you took a cab?
ELAINE: Yeah? So?
KRAMER: How much do you make?
ELAINE: I'm not telling you.
KRAMER: C'mon.
ELAINE: No!
KRAMER: I'll tell you how much I make.
ELAINE: I know how much you make. I don't even know why I'm doing this, I don't even like basketball.
KRAMER: You ever seen Michael Jordan?
ELAINE: Just in those commercials.
KRAMER: Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
ELAINE: What's that?
KRAMER: Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
ELAINE: Huh?
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Kramer then drives to 'the hoop' and tumbles headfirst into a bunch of garbage cans.)
[Cut back to 'O'Brien' and 'Murphy' in the limo.]
JERRY: (checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
TIM: You think someone's been tipped off?
GEORGE: So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
EVA: (fawning) Yes I've read it and I've memorized it.
GEORGE: Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
EVA: Well, this is sort of embarrassing, but it's changed my life. The way you analyzed the game? The way you identify the major players? Well it left me breathless. You're a brilliant, brilliant man.
GEORGE: Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
TIM: Just a game. He's so humble. Don't forget what you wrote in the epilogue, the fate of the world depends on the outcome of this game.
GEORGE: Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
JERRY: He tends to exaggerate.
GEORGE: Okay, I mean it's serious but--
EVA: We are really looking forward to your speech tonight.
GEORGE: Uh, my speech?
EVA: Yes, your secretary faxed me the copy. Would you like to look it over?
JERRY: Well you might as well look it over.
[Cut back to Kramer and Elaine waiting on the corner.]
KRAMER: So what's going on, how did all this happen?
ELAINE: Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
KRAMER: Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
ELAINE: He did.
KRAMER: Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
ELAINE: I don't know.
KRAMER: That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
ELAINE: Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
KRAMER: O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
[Cut back to the limo, George is reading from O'Brien's speech.]
GEORGE: ...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
JERRY: You're not going to open with that, are you?
EVA: What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
GEORGE: I said so many things.
(Suddenly they hear a loud bang.)
GEORGE: They're shooting! They're shooting!
TIM: (pulling out a gun) Alright, get down!
(The limo comes to a screeching halt. Tim exits the limo to look around, Eva has fallen on top of George.)
EVA. Ohhh. I'm ready to die for you.
GEORGE: That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
EVA: But of course you know I would. I would do anything for you. Anything.
(Tim returns.)
TIM: Nothing to worry about, it was just a flat tire. But rest assured, we're prepared to handle anything that might come up.
Tim opens a briefcase filled with firearms. Eva grabs one and starts handling it sensually.
JERRY: Nice looking Lugar.
{Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.}
JODI: I'm standing in front of the Paramount adjacent to Madison Square Garden where a growing number of vociferous and angry demonstrators are gathering to protest the very first public appearance of Donald O'Brien, the leader of the midwestern regional chapter of the Aryan Union, and reputed to be their most charismatic spokesman. The reclusive Mr. O'Brien is an advocate of the violent overthrow of the government. He has openly professed a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler. Even David Duke has denounced him as a dangerous extremist. There is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport. Sources tell me he is in route and should be arriving momentarily. Police have set up barricades, but quite frankly Bill and Jean, I don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight. Reporting from the Paramount, I'm Jodi Baskerville, back to you in the studio.
[Cut back to Kramer and Elaine on the corner.]
KRAMER: Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
(A group of people approach from the adjacent sidewalk. One of them recognized Elaine.)
DAN: Elaine?
ELAINE: Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
DAN: Good.
ELAINE: Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
DAN: Oh, Kramer?
(They shake hands.)
ELAINE: What's going on?
DAN: Oh, we're heading down to protest this big neo-nazi rally. The head of the Aryan Union is speaking, he's in from Chicago. You should come.
ELAINE: Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
DAN: Oh, well that's where the rally is. The Paramount, right next door.
ELAINE: Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
DAN: Yeah, yeah ok. It's really gonna be something, this is the first time he's ever appeared in public, no one even knows what he looks like.
KRAMER: Who?
DAN: The head of the Aryan Union; O'Brien.
[Cut back to the limo.]
(Jerry and George are alone inside.)
JERRY: What's taking him so long out there?
GEORGE: Didja see the way she was looking at me?
JERRY: She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
GEORGE: I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
JERRY: Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
GEORGE: I don't know.
JERRY: Let's just make a run for it.
GEORGE: I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
JERRY: How'd that happen?
GEORGE: I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
JERRY: I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
GEORGE: For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
(George grabs the phone and dials.)
GEORGE: 9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
(Tim re-enters the limo.)
GEORGE: --Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
TIM: We'll be ready in a minute.
GEORGE: Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
TIM: With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien, we're just about to leave.
GEORGE: Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
TIM: You are.
GEORGE: And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
TIM: You are.
GEORGE: Good. I think you forgot something.
TIM: I'm sorry.
GEORGE: Good. Now get out.
(Tim leaves.)
GEORGE: Okay, what are we gonna do?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
JERRY: Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
[Cut back to Elaine and Kramer on the corner.]
KRAMER: I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
ELAINE: I'm sure he was just joking around.
KRAMER: Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
ELAINE: What is it?
KRAMER: Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
ELAINE: Jerry's a nazi?!
KRAMER: I can't believe I didn't see it.
ELAINE: Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
KRAMER: You don't think so.
ELAINE: No, he's just neat.
[Cut back to the limo]
TIM: You know it's funny. You don't look like an O'Brien.
GEORGE: Me??
(George and Jerry laugh nervously.)
TIM: And you really don't look like a Murphy.
JERRY: I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
GEORGE: He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
TIM: Where are you from?
JERRY: Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
TIM: Sounds more like Scottish.
JERRY: We were right on the border.
[Cut back to the street corner]
KRAMER: Maybe he's with the company.
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
ELAINE: What about his comedy act?
KRAMER: That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
ELAINE: What about George?
KRAMER: What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
ELAINE: I'll bet they were even in on it.
KRAMER: Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
ELAINE: Kramer, you're hurting me!
[Quick cut to the now approaching limo.]
GEORGE: Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
ELAINE: Get off of me!!
(The limo pulls over and George and Jerry get out.)
KRAMER: O'Brien.
(This attracts the attention of Dan and his friends standing at a nearby bus stop.)
MAN #1: O'Brien? Is that him?
MAN #2: Yeah, that's him.
MAN #3: Look there's O'Brien!
MAN #4: Filthy nazi bastard!
ALL FOUR MEN: Let's get him!!
(They begin running full speed towards the gang.)
GEORGE: What do I do?! What do I do?!
JERRY: Get in the car! Get in the car!
(George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer all jump into the limo which speeds off.)
KRAMER: (pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
TIM: Why did you call him O'Brien and him Murphy?
JERRY: No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
ELAINE: It could be very confusing.
(The limo phone rings Kramer answers it.)
KRAMER: Yeah? Eva?
EVA: It's for me. (takes phone) Hello? (cups receiver) It's O'Brien.
KRAMER: O'Brien? Well that's weird.
EVA: (gun drawn) Who are you?
(George and Jerry begin simultaneous explanations about how George's car broke down when he went to pick Jerry up at the airport.)
[Cut back to Jodi Baskerville, reporting live.]
JODI: A limousine has just pulled up it's being surrounded by a huge group of protestors, this has the makings of a very ugly scene.
[Cut back to the limo, Elaine has joined the group explanation, none of the three are intelligible at this point.]
JODI: They are banging on the car, trying to flip it over. The police seem unable or unwilling to control the crowd, I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be having some very grave doubts if he made the right choice for his first public appearance.
Cut back to the limo. The explanations are becoming more heated and less understandable, the limo is rocking violently and Tim and Eva are becoming unnerved.
EVA: Get out!!
ELAINE: Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
DAN: Elaine?
ELAINE: Hey!
[Cut to George in front of a news camera, the on screen graphic says 'DONALD O'BRIEN Leader of the Aryan Union'.]
GEORGE: I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
[Closing monologue]
So I was watching this movie the other night, it was a World War Two movie and there was Nazis in the movie and I noticed that the Nazis in those movies always had like two separate heils. They had like the regular heil that they would do and then when they were around the offices they had like this casual heil, remember that one, you ever notice that? They come in, yeah, heil, how are ya, is the kid back with the coffee yet? Come on, are you finished with the copier? Yeah. World domination, Aryan race, whose donuts are those? Yeah, heil, nice to see ya, can I have one of those donuts?
[Jerry is driving alone talking on his car phone to Elaine at home in her bed]
ELAINE: You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
JERRY: It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
(Driver cuts in front of Jerry)
JERRY: Oh look at this guy.
ELAINE: What's goin' on?
JERRY: Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
ELAINE: Did you get a thank you wave?
JERRY: No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
(Jerry sticks his head out the window)
JERRY: Give me that wave!
ELAINE: Jerry, are you free on Friday?
JERRY: Yeah, I'm free, why?
ELAINE: Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
JERRY: Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
ELAINE: You gotta follow that car!
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: You can't let him get away with that!
JERRY: Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
ELAINE: What are you, yellow?
JERRY: I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
ELAINE: Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
JERRY: Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
ELAINE: What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
[Scene moves outside where Jerry get out of his car to confront other driver, who as they come out of their car, is an attractive woman]
JERRY: Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
(They both smile flirtatiously at each other)
[Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry and George are talking by the table]
JERRY: So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
GEORGE: Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
JERRY: You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
(Reaches out to touch Georges arm to demonstrate)
JERRY: He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
GEORGE: I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
JERRY: Let's not even analyze it.
(Jerry begins walking towards door)
GEORGE: So you didn't turn her in?
JERRY: I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
GEORGE: Gonna see her again?
JERRY: Friday night.
(Intercom buzzes, Jerry presses the button)
JERRY: Yep.
ELAINE: It's me!
JERRY: Come on up.
(Jerry unlocks and opens door)
JERRY: By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
(George walks into kitchen and opens cupboard to get cups)
JERRY: Oh, you dig?
GEORGE: Yes! I see enormous potential here.
JERRY: Why?
(George pours two cups of milk)
GEORGE: Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
JERRY: I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
GEORGE: I don't think so.
JERRY: Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
(Jerry takes a drink of his milk while both remain silent)
JERRY: On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
(Jerry looks at his cup in disgust)
JERRY: What am I drinking, milk?
(Elaine enters, hanging up her jacket)
ELAINE: Hey!
JERRY: Hi.
(Elaine tosses a sweater to Jerry)
ELAINE: Sweater.
JERRY: Thank you.
ELAINE: So? What happened?
(Jerry starts walking away)
JERRY: With that?
ELAINE: With the car!
JERRY: What car?
ELAINE: The hit and run!
JERRY: Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
ELAINE: Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
JERRY: Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
(George walks out of the kitchen)
GEORGE: Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
JERRY: Yeah, Queens.
ELAINE: So? Then what?
JERRY: So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
(Elaine gasps)
JERRY: So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
(Elaine stutters with her mouth open in amazement)
ELAINE: I am speechless. I am without speech.
GEORGE: Tell her about the shoving.
JERRY: What?
(George smiles pointing at him)
ELAINE: What shoving?!
JERRY: Oh, it was nothing.
GEORGE: No! Tell her.
(Jerry looks at George with a grin)
JERRY: Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
ELAINE: You know karate??
JERRY: I know a little.
ELAINE: Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
JERRY: He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey! (Group does likewise)
ELAINE: Did you tell Kramer?
JERRY: Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
KRAMER: What? What? What? Tell me.
ELAINE: Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
(Jerry looks at Kramer and raises both his arms smiling)
KRAMER: Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
KRAMER: They should be sent to Australia.
(Jerry has a confused look)
JERRY: Australia?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
JERRY: But not anymore.
KRAMER: No.
(Everyone pauses and looks at Kramer)
ELAINE: Hey Kramer, Kramer!
KRAMER: Yeah?
ELAINE: What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
KRAMER: I don't know!
(Jerry smiles and shakes his head)
KRAMER: You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
(Elaine has a look of surprise)
ELAINE: Well, that is, that is strange.
KRAMER: Yep. (Mumbles off)
(Elaine walks toward door)
ELAINE: Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
JERRY: Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
(Elaine closes door and walks back toward Jerry)
ELAINE: But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
JERRY: We just met.
(Kramer is tapping his temple with his finger)
KRAMER: Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
ELAINE: But I, I can't go alone!
JERRY: Ask George to go with you.
ELAINE: George, come on! I'll pay for you.
GEORGE: You'll pay? I'm there.
JERRY: Why do you even need anybody?
ELAINE: Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
[Scene moves to restaurant with Elaine, George, and the married couple,]
Michael and Robin, sitting down talking, George is mainly focused on eating his meal)
ROBIN: You went out with a bullfighter?
ELAINE: Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
MICHAEL: Wow.
ROBIN: What was his name?
ELAINE: His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
(George points across the table)
GEORGE: Pass the salt please.
ROBIN: Where did you meet him?
ELAINE: Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
(Elaine and couple laugh, George points at the bread)
GEORGE: Bread.
(Elaine hands bread to George)
ELAINE: I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
(Robin sneezes, no one says anything, George lifts his head and looks at Michael)
GEORGE: God bless you.
(Robin smiles)
ROBIN: Thank you.
GEORGE: I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
(Michael stops pouring wine and looks seriously at George)
[Scene moves to Jerry's car, where Jerry and hit-and-run woman are both eating an ice cream cones]
WOMAN: You know who's a good actor? Anthony Quinn.
JERRY: Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
WOMAN: Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?
JERRY: Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
(Woman touches Jerry's hair, smiling)
WOMAN: Come here. (moves in for a kiss)
[Scene moves back to restaurant where an argument has developed between Michael and George]
GEORGE: Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
ROBIN: He was only joking Michael.
(Michael throws down his serviette)
MICHAEL: You think you're so damn special because you say 'God bless you'?
GEORGE: No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
ROBIN: He was only joking Michael! Sorry.
MICHAEL: All right! Take his side!
ROBIN: I am not taking his side.
MICHAEL: Well who's side are you taking?!
ROBIN: Well I'm not taking your side!
(Robin sneezes, George gestures to Michael that the floor is his)
[Scene moves back to Jerry's car, where Jerry and the hit-and-run woman are now kissing]
JERRY: Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
(Woman pulls Jerry back in and starts kissing him again)
[Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment with George talking outside Jerry's room]
GEORGE: I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
JERRY: The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
(George makes a confused look. The intercom buzzes, Jerry walks over and presses the button)
ELAINE: It's me.
JERRY: Come on up.
(Jerry unlocks door, conversation moves into kitchen)
GEORGE: Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this: Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
JERRY: No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
GEORGE: Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
JERRY: What if she's having an off night?
(Elaine walks in, Jerry goes to sit down on sofa)
ELAINE: Hi!
JERRY: Hi.
(Elaine takes her coat off and walks into kitchen)
ELAINE: Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
(George walks out of kitchen)
GEORGE: Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
(Jerry sneezes)
GEORGE: Ah, shut up.
ELAINE: What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
(Elaine sits on sofa, George sits on arm of sofa)
JERRY: A stupid what?
(Elaine looks at Jerry)
ELAINE: Whatever.
JERRY: You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
(Elaine nods, George rolls his eyes)
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
GEORGE: Who?
ELAINE: Robin!
(George looks quickly at Elaine)
GEORGE: Why?!
ELAINE: Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
(George stands up)
JERRY: Entertainment Tonight's on.
GEORGE: Where's the remote phone?
JERRY: Bedroom.
(George walks toward Jerry's bedroom)
ELAINE: Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
(Theme music plays on TV, Kramer walks in, waves at Jerry and Elaine, then walks over to Jerry's bookshelf, dancing to the music. Voice of Mary Hart starts on TV and Kramer starts having a wild seizure behind the sofa.)
JERRY: What's it like out?
(Kramer continues to shake behind sofa)
ELAINE: Chilly out.
JERRY: Can I take a sweater?
ELAINE: Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
JERRY: Scarf?
ELAINE: Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
(Jerry and Elaine finally notice Kramer as he finishes)
JERRY: What's the matter? What's going on?
(Kramer is looking around like he's lost)
KRAMER: What happened?!
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: I think I hit my head again!
JERRY: What is wrong?!
(Elaine is pointing at the TV)
ELAINE: Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Elaine claps her hands together then stands up)
ELAINE: That is it!
KRAMER: What?
(Elaine walks toward Kramer pointing her finger at him)
ELAINE: That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
(George walks out of Jerry's bedroom toward kitchen, Kramer sits down)
KRAMER: Mary Hart!
GEORGE: God.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
JERRY: Get together?
GEORGE: Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
ELAINE: Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
(George walks to other side of sofa)
GEORGE: Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
(George sits on chair)
ELAINE: Are you actually considering this?
GEORGE: I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
ELAINE: Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
(Jerry moves around sofa as if uncomfortable)
JERRY: Yeah.
(Kramer walks out of washroom)
KRAMER: Hey, you know who owns that car?
JERRY: What car?
KRAMER: The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
JERRY: Yeah who?
KRAMER: That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
(Jerry stands up and walks toward kitchen)
JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
(Elaine nods, smiling)
ELAINE: Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
(Elaine walks out door, Kramer follows)
KRAMER: Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
(Jerry closes door behind them, then runs over to George very excited)
JERRY: The blond with the blue sweatpants!
GEORGE: Well, who is she?
JERRY: I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
GEORGE: Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
(Jerry sits down, disgruntled, flips aimlessly through a magazine)
JERRY: Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
(Jerry and George are both pointing their fingers at each other)
GEORGE: You can't compromise your principles!
JERRY: How am I going to live with myself?!
GEORGE: Can't live!
JERRY: I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
GEORGE: This country needs more people like you!
JERRY: Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
GEORGE: I believe strongly in that as you know.
JERRY: There should be more people like us.
GEORGE: That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
JERRY: You're telling me.
(Jerry and George both flip pages simultaneously and start reading their magazines)
[Scene moves to apartment across street, where Jerry is talking to the girl with the blue sweatpants, Becky Gelke, outside her door]
JERRY: Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
(Becky touches Jerry's arm, smiling)
BECKY: Well God bless you.
(Jerry pauses)
JERRY: Thank you very much.
[Scene moves to George's apartment, where George and Robin are together in bed]
GEORGE: Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
ROBIN: Oh no, what's wrong?
GEORGE: What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
ROBIN: You didn't commit adultery, I did.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
ROBIN: If I didn't do it with you, I would have done it with someone else.
GEORGE: Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
ROBIN: Maybe even someone who didn't say 'God bless you'.
GEORGE: Well, that's a given.
ROBIN: In three years with Michael, not one 'God bless you'.
GEORGE: Must be hell living in that house.
[Scene moves to Elaine's apartment, where she is talking on the phone to Michael]
MICHAEL: Hi, it's Michael.
ELAINE: Hi, Michael!
MICHAEL: Is Robin there?
ELAINE: Robin? No, why?
MICHAEL: Uh, she said she was going to be with you.
ELAINE: No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
(Elaine sits on the couch and crumples newspaper into the phone)
MICHAEL: If she's not with you, then where is she?
ELAINE: Well I, I don't know.
MICHAEL: Is she with your bald friend from the other night?!
ELAINE: No, no, come on Michael!
MICHAEL: He's finished! I'm going to sew his ass to his face! I'm going to twist his neck so hard his lips will be his eyebrows! I'm going to break his joints, and reattach them!
(Michael sneezes)
ELAINE: You're soo good lookin'.
[Scene moves back to Jerry's apartment, where Jerry and Angela are talking by the sofa]
ANGELA: Now you listen to me, suck face! You tell anybody, anything, and I will carve my initials in your brain tissue!
JERRY: Let me rephra-
ANGELA: I'll bash your skull into a vegematic like a bad cabbage, and I'll have a party on your head!
(Elaine walks in)
JERRY: Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
ANGELA: I'll pluck all your body hairs out with my teeth!
(Jerry walks past her away from the kitchen)
JERRY: Well I think I get the gist of it.
ANGELA: So you don't say anything to anybody about me hitting that car!
(Jerry shrugs)
JERRY: What car?
(Jerry hands Angela her purse)
ANGELA: Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
JERRY: It's not complicated.
(Angela walks out and down hall, Elaine waves)
ELAINE: Very nice meeting you!
(Intercom buzzes, Elaine hits button while walking toward Jerry)
ELAINE: Come on up.
(Elaine laughs)
ELAINE: Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
JERRY: Alright Elaine.
ELAINE: No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
JERRY: It was just a couple of blocks.
(Elaine takes cup from Jerry and sets it on counter)
ELAINE: Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
(George walks in open door, and into kitchen. Elaine walks toward him, Jerry goes to washroom)
GEORGE: Hey.
ELAINE: Oh, did you check you machine?
(George takes glass from cupboard)
GEORGE: No, why, what's happening?
ELAINE: Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
GEORGE: Yeah, okay.
ELAINE: And I said I hadn't seen her.
GEORGE: What?!
ELAINE: No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
GEORGE: He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
ELAINE: He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
GEORGE: What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
ELAINE: Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
GEORGE: You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
(Jerry walks back from washroom)
JERRY: It's not that hard.
(Elaine points finger at George)
ELAINE: Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
GEORGE: It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
ELAINE: Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
GEORGE: Oh don't-
(Jerry raises his arms)
JERRY: Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
GEORGE: She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
JERRY: A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
ELAINE: Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
(Jerry uses hand towel to mimic matador)
JERRY: Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
[Scene moves to Becky's apartment, where Jerry is talking to her outside her door)
JERRY: Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
BECKY: Well, I already got an estimate. It's $875.
JERRY: $875?
BECKY: That's right.
JERRY: Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
(Jerry takes out checkbook, and start writing)
JERRY: Um, who do I make it out to?
BECKY: Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.
JERRY: So, what are you doing this weekend?
(Jerry hands check to Becky)
BECKY: You have got some nerve! You smash up my car, you don't admit it, and now you want to ask me out on a date?
JERRY: I didn't do it!
BECKY: Yeah righ-
(Becky sneezes)
JERRY: You are soo good lookin'.
(Becky closes door)
BECKY: Thank you.
[Scene moves to Jerry's apartment where Jerry is changing in bedroom and George is looking out window]
GEORGE: Jerry, let's go! You ready?
(Jerry walks out of bedroom)
JERRY: You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
GEORGE: Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
JERRY: Alright!
(George put his bag over his shoulder)
GEORGE: Come on let's get out of here.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: How could you?
JERRY: What?!
KRAMER: Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
JERRY: What did I do?
KRAMER: I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
JERRY: I-
KRAMER: I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
JERRY: I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
KRAMER: Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
(Jerry is putting on sweater)
JERRY: No, never.
KRAMER: Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
JERRY: You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
KRAMER: Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
GEORGE: Jerry, can we get out of here?!
KRAMER: As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
JERRY: Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
(Jerry yanks coat out of George's hands)
[Scene moves to outside Becky's apartment. Kramer is walking toward her door, hair slicked back, with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. He knocks on her door, she opens. Mary Hart's voice is playing on the TV in the distance. Kramer starts having a violent seizure.]
[ACT 1]
(Nina's art studio. Kramer is posing for Nina (Jerry's current girlfriend.)
NINA: (laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I can't do this if you keep moving.
KRAMER: You sure you don't want me to take my clothes off? (beat) I'll do it!
NINA: No, that's the last thing in the world I want you to do.
KRAMER: Well, why don't you take your clothes off?
NINA: I don't know... I don't think Jerry would like that.
KRAMER: (debonair smile) Well, it'd be our little secret.
[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
JERRY: I like the button fly.
GEORGE: (incredulous) What?
JERRY: That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. It's like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
GEORGE: Nothing.
JERRY: I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
GEORGE: I don't get art.
JERRY: There's nothing to get.
GEORGE: Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
JERRY: She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
GEORGE: What for?
JERRY: She sees something in him.
GEORGE: So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
[CUT TO: Nina's studio again--same scene]
KRAMER: Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
NINA: Tell me about Elaine.
KRAMER: She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
NINA: But, they're still friends.
KRAMER: Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
NINA: Don't you think that's strange?
KRAMER: Why, what's the difference?
NINA: Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?
KRAMER: Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
[CUT TO: the door outside Nina's studio]
GEORGE: You know, I'm a little nervous.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
JERRY: I don't know how long this is gonna last.
GEORGE: Really? I thought you liked her.
JERRY: I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
GEORGE: You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
(Nina opens the door)
JERRY: Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
NINA: How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George nods)
JERRY: (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
KRAMER: Yeah!
JERRY: (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
NINA: Oh, are you interested?
GEORGE: (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
KRAMER: George, you gonna buy a painting?
GEORGE: (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
NINA: Are you an art-lover?
GEORGE: I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
NINA: Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like. (George reluctantly begins to look around, while Jerry strolls over to the painting-in-progress [Kramer] and picks up a brush.)
JERRY: May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
NINA: (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands Jerry a small white envelope)
JERRY: What's this?
NINA: My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday afternoon. Owner's box, first row behind the dugout.
JERRY: (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
NINA: Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 'em?
KRAMER: (immediately) Yeah.
JERRY: They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
GEORGE: Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
NINA: Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's box.
GEORGE: All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
NINA: (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently look-ing at and happens to be holding) You like that one?
[CUT TO: Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being lead to their seats]
GEORGE: Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
USHER: No, no, these are your seats.
GEORGE: She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
ELAINE: Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
GEORGE: I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
ELAINE: Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
GEORGE: Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
KRAMER: Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
ELAINE: I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
GEORGE: (amused) You're supposed to do that?
ELAINE: (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
GEORGE: I'd rather go to a hanging.
ELAINE: Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
KRAMER: (screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
JOHNNY, 'CAUSE THIS AIN'T PHILIDELPHIA!!
(a man approaches the trio)
MAN: George?
GEORGE: Yeah?
MAN: Hi. I'm Leonard West, Nina's father.
GEORGE: Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
ELAINE: Hi!
KRAMER: (screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
GEORGE: --and this is Kramer.
KRAMER: Oh, hey.
(the Yankees make a good play, the crowd applauds)
WEST: So how are the seats?
GEORGE: Okay.
ELAINE: Great, great.
KRAMER: Yeah.
WEST: George, I heard you bought one of Nina's paintings.
GEORGE: Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
WEST: Well, if you have a lot of money.
(Yankees make a horrible play, the crowd responds)
WEST: (leaving) Well, enjoy the game. (beat -- to Elaine) I think you better take off that Orioles cap.
ELAINE: (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
WEST: No, no, no. Seriously. You're in the owner's box, and I don't think it's a good idea.
ELAINE: You're not serious.
WEST: Yes, yes, yes, I am!
ELAINE: Well, did he say that?
WEST: No, no, but he gave me the seats. I don't think he'd like it if you wore an Orioles cap.
ELAINE: Well maybe you should ask him!
WEST: I don't have to ask him! Now are you gonna take the hat off or not?
ELAINE: No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
GEORGE: Just take the cap off.
ELAINE: George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
WEST: Look. Either you take the cap off, or you'll have to leave.
ELAINE: Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
GEORGE: Just take the cap off!
ELAINE: No!
(a fight starts between Elaine and George; Elaine ends up taking off
GEORGE'S hat, and throwing it onto the field... West calls security over, they proceed to remove Elaine)
KRAMER: Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
GEORGE: (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
KRAMER: (getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
ELAINE: (sarcastically, to George) Stay!
GEORGE: Okay, we'll go!
(meanwhile Kramer is climbing over the dugout retrieve George's cap... the camera cuts to the field where the batter hits a pop fly to where Kramer is: the ball knocks him squarely in the head, he falls off the dugout onto the crowd)
[END OF ACT 1]
[ACT 2]
(Jerry's apartment--day)
ELAINE: ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
JERRY: Is he okay?
ELAINE: Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
JERRY: This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
ELAINE: I know! Can you imagine that?
(Kramer enters with a bandage wrapper around his forehead)
JERRY: How you feeling?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
ELAINE: Wha- a picture?
KRAMER: A picture.
ELAINE: OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
KRAMER: Uh-huh.
(they all crowd around, looking at the picture)
ELAINE: (gasps) I cannot believe this!
JERRY: (pointing) There's George!
KRAMER: Yup, yup!
ELAINE: Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
[CUT TO: Lippman's office. Lippman is at his desk, Elaine enters.]
ELAINE: Hi, Mr. Lippman.
LIPPMAN:How's your father?
ELAINE: My, my father?
LIPPMAN:Yeah. You, you went to see him, right?
ELAINE: Yeah.
LIPPMAN:Uh-huh.
ELAINE: I went to visit him.
LIPPMAN:Uh-huh. So, what was wrong with him?
ELAINE: Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
LIPPMAN:But--but he's feeling better now?
ELAINE: Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
LIPPMAN:(correcting her) Boo-eed.
ELAINE: What--what did I say?
LIPPMAN:You said "boyed."
ELAINE: I did?
LIPPMAN:Yeah.
(Elaine starts to laugh hysterically, and at the same time discreetly removes Lippman's sports section from his desk. She manages to maneuver it into her lap, out of sight.)
LIPPMAN:Well, I got a plane to catch.
ELAINE: Oh! Where are you going?
LIPPMAN:Going to Houston. It's a publisher's convention. (beat) Can I have my sports section?
ELAINE: Ah. ...Yeah.
LIPPMAN:I've been saving it for the plane. I never miss the Sunday sports section.
ELAINE: There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
LIPPMAN:Right, right. (starts to take the paper from Elaine's hand; Elaine holds on tight.) What, what are you doing?
ELAINE: Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
LIPPMAN:Gotta go.
ELAINE: Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
[CUT TO: Nina's studio. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are admiring Nina's "Kramer."]
MRS.ARM:I sense great vulcrability. A land child crying out for love, an innocent orphan in the post-modern world.
MR. ARM:I see a parasite.
MRS.ARM:A sexually-depraved miscrient, who is seeking to gratify only his most basic and immediate urges.
[CUT TO: Another part of the studio where Jerry and Nina are arguing.]
NINA: She was a guest of my father's. She should've taken the cap off.
JERRY: It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
[CUT TO: Armstrongs admiring painting again.]
MRS.ARM:He is struggled, he is man-struggled. He lifts my spirit!
MR. ARM:He is a loathsome, offensive brute, yet I can't look away.
[CUT TO: Jerry and Nina again.]
JERRY: Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
NINA: Oh, well, you wouldn't want that because you always have to remain friends!
JERRY: Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
NINA: Hey -- why don't you just go then! And -- oh, give this to George. Tell him he owes me $500!
[CUT TO: Armstrongs]
MRS.ARM:He transcends time and space.
MR. ARM:He sickens me.
MRS.ARM:I love it.
MR. ARM:Me too.
[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: Five-hundred dollars?! What?
JERRY: That's what she told me!
GEORGE: I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
JERRY: That's what it costs!
GEORGE: Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
JERRY: I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
GEORGE: You weren't thinking.
JERRY: Well, she framed it and everything.
GEORGE: Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
JERRY: Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
GEORGE: I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
KRAMER: (entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
GEORGE: Hey, Kramer.
KRAMER: Hi, Mike.
JERRY: (looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
KRAMER: (notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
JERRY: (reading note) Oh my god!
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: This is amazing, you can't believe this!
GEORGE: What's it say?
JERRY: Listen to this: "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
GEORGE: WOW!
KRAMER: (emotionally) She's deep.
JERRY: (reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
(Kramer blows his noes loudly) "...because I'm sure as hell fighting for you!"
KRAMER: You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
JERRY: No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
KRAMER: (pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
JERRY: Should I?
KRAMER: (screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
JERRY: ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment, another day. Jerry is helping Nina put on her coat. The TV is on a horse race.]
JERRY: SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
GEORGE: (on intercom) It's George.
JERRY: Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
NINA: What's the appeal of the posse?
JERRY: The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
(George enters)
NINA: Hello, George.
GEORGE: Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
NINA: Well, I really love that piece.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
NINA: No, no no no, George! A deal's a deal. I want you to have it!
GEORGE: This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
NINA: Honestly, George, the money's not important.
GEORGE: Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
JERRY: Yeah?
ELAINE: (on intercom) It's Elaine.
JERRY: Come on up.
NINA: Elaine?
JERRY: ...Yeah.
NINA: (rolling eyes) This person does not believe in telephones, does she?
JERRY: She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
GEORGE: I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: How 'bout Kramer.
JERRY: HUGE pop-in guy!
NINA: Well, I was leaving anyway, so, uh, we're on for tomorrow?
JERRY: Yeah.
NINA: Okay.
JERRY: Okay!
NINA: Bye. (just as Nina is about to leave, Elaine walks in.)
ELAINE: (to Nina) Hello!
(Nina doesn't respond, just walks past Elaine)
ELAINE: (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
JERRY: If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
ELAINE: No, he wants to torture me.
[CUT TO: later on that night. George, Elaine, and Jerry are watching TV.Jerry, with the remote, is furiously flipping through channels.]
ELAINE: (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
JERRY: (tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
ELAINE: You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
(another tug-o-war starts)
JERRY: Let go!
ELAINE: No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
JERRY: Let go, Elaine!
ELAINE: Well at least let George do it!
JERRY: Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
GEORGE: (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
(George starts clicking, the first station he lands on is playing Neil Simon's Chapter 2. After a few seconds, George gets bored, and changes the station)
JERRY: Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
ELAINE: It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
JERRY: (on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
ELAINE: What letter?
JERRY: This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
(Jerry get up to go find the letter. A second later, he returns, and starts reading in unison with movie on TV.)
JERRY: "...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
GEORGE: This is incredible!
JERRY: I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
GEORGE: Maybe I won't send her that check.
ELAINE: You know, it's not really that terrible.
JERRY: What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
[CUT TO: Lippman's office. Lippman is on the phone when Elaine walks in and places something on his desk. After she does, she tries to leave but Lippman, still on the phone, motions for her to stay in the room]
LIPPMAN:(into phone)...yeah, yeah. But she wouldn't take the cap off? (beat) But didn't she know they were the owner's seats? (beat) Aw, that's unbelievable. (beat) Yeah. Okay. Alright Lenny, thanks again. Take care. (hangs up the phone, and then, to Elaine) That was Lenny West, my accountant, who is a hell of a guy. And he handles the Yankees too; it's his biggest account. So every once in a while they throw him a couple of seats and last weekend he gave them to his daughter. She's an artist, by the way. Anyway, her daughter gives 'em to some friends, you know. One of her friends shows up wearing a Baltimore cap! (beat) You're from Baltimore, right?
ELAINE: Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
LIPPMAN:Yeah, but you're an Oriole fan, right?
ELAINE: Well, uh, fan. My father--
LIPPMAN:Anyway, she refused to take the cap off; caused a whole big scene!
ELAINE: Really?
LIPPMAN:Yeah.
ELAINE: So... impudent.
LIPPMAN:Yeah, so Lenny gave me the tickets for tomorrow night. I'm inviting Frank and Marsha. 'Wantcha to come.
ELAINE: (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
LIPPMAN:Well, break 'em. You missed the bris, I want you at the game.
ELAINE: (very reluctant) Okay.
LIPPMAN:Good. (Elaine stars to leave) Oh--and Elaine. You know the Baltimore cap you got in your office? Wear it. I'm gonna have a little fun with him.
ELAINE: That will be fun.
[CUT TO: Nina's studio. Nina is working on a painting. Jerry is watching her, sitting on the sofa.]
JERRY: How's it coming?
NINA: Good, good.
JERRY: Seen any good movies lately?
NINA: No... not really. You?
JERRY: No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
NINA: Neil Simon? Uh, some of his stuff.
JERRY: I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
NINA: I don't know... maybe.
JERRY: I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
MR. ARM:Well, we've made our decision. We want "The Kramer."
[CUT TO: Jerry's apartment, night. Jerry and George are watching a baseball game and talking.]
GEORGE: Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
JERRY: Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
GEORGE: So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
JERRY: Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
GEORGE: Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
(the Yankees announcer is heard on TV)
TVVOICE: Uh, there's seems to be a lot of trouble in the area just behind the Yankee dugout.
GEORGE: Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
TVVOICE: Well, we're not going to show it, we don't want to encourage that kind of behavior. Say, it's a young lady, and boy she's really going at it with the security guard. She's a fiesty one. And now they're getting the other security guard to come down. How do you like that Seegers? Boy, she's someting. (beat) And a ball to left field..."
(Jerry and George look at each other, wondering.)
[CUT TO: the Armstrong's dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong are having Kramer over for dinner.]
KRAMER: ...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
MRS.ARM: More potatoes?
KRAMER: Yeah, sure. Please.
MR. ARM:Yes, yes. Go on. You hopped a steamship to Sweden?
KRAMER: Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
END OF ACT 2
[Opening monologue]
At parking lots now they have these 'compact car only' spots, isn't that discrimination against the size of your car? If I want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot, that's my business. There are people out there with real asses hanging out of their pants, nobody's stopping them. Nobody goes, "Hey, hold it, sir. Those are compact jeans, you can't pull that in there."
[Jerry is in his apartment, Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
JERRY: What are you talking about?
KRAMER: Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
JERRY: Oh yeah, I know.
KRAMER: Well, where is it?
JERRY: What's the difference?
KRAMER: Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
JERRY: You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
KRAMER: What happened to the car?
JERRY: If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
JERRY: You have to know, you must know.
KRAMER: I must know.
JERRY: Well, I'm not telling you.
KRAMER: Oh, come on.
JERRY: Nope. I don't think so.
KRAMER: Well, please?
JERRY: Not today, pal.
KRAMER: Okay, I beg you.
JERRY: Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
KRAMER: Okay, please! Please tell me!
JERRY: Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
KRAMER: Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
JERRY: I loaned the car to George.
KRAMER: Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
JERRY: George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
KRAMER: Alright.
JERRY: Huh?
KRAMER: Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
JERRY: Will you stop it already?!
KRAMER: You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
JERRY: I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
KRAMER: What, they don't like me?
JERRY: *I* don't like you!
KRAMER: If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
[George and Elaine are in Jerry's car. George is wearing a new hat.]
GEORGE: I really think it looks good.
ELAINE: Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
GEORGE: All bald people look good in hats.
ELAINE: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
GEORGE: What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
ELAINE: Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
GEORGE: No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
ELAINE: Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
Elaine moves the rear view mirror so she can check out her sunglasses and this causes George to swerve and hit something.
[Cut back to Kramer and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.]
KRAMER: Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
JERRY: Why not?
KRAMER: Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
JERRY: Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
(Kramer and Jerry start 'sparring'.)
KRAMER: Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
JERRY: No, I like Mike.
KRAMER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
JERRY: Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
KRAMER: Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
JERRY: Oh yeah? What did he say?
KRAMER: You have to know everything, don't you?
JERRY: No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
KRAMER: Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
JERRY: Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
KRAMER: Beg me.
JERRY: Please, don't make me beg.
KRAMER: No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
JERRY: Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
KRAMER: No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
JERRY: Kramer!
KRAMER: Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
JERRY: Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
KRAMER: Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
JERRY: I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
KRAMER: He thinks you're a phony.
JERRY: He what?
KRAMER: I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
JERRY: A phony? He called me a phony?
KRAMER: A big phone. A big one.
JERRY: Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
KRAMER: You begged me.
[Cut back to Elaine and George in Jerry's car, the car is now making a clanking noise.]
GEORGE: Do you hear that?
ELAINE: Of course I hear that.
GEORGE: You had to move the mirror?
ELAINE: I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
GEORGE: I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
ELAINE: Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
GEORGE: I can't drive?
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
ELAINE: No, I really don't.
GEORGE: And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
ELAINE: I'm sure you could.
GEORGE: What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
ELAINE: I don't know.
GEORGE: Alright, start looking for spaces.
ELAINE: Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
GEORGE: Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
ELAINE: Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
GEORGE: I can't park in a garage.
ELAINE: Why?
GEORGE: I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
ELAINE: I'll pay for it.
GEORGE: You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
ELAINE: (pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
GEORGE: (putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
ELAINE: You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
(They share a laugh.)
GEORGE: Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
ELAINE: Will you just park it already?
GEORGE: There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
ELAINE: George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
GEORGE: No no no, he's not getting away with this.
ELAINE: George?
(George gets out of the car to confront the other driver.)
GEORGE: Hey, what are you doing?
MIKE: I think I'm parking my car.
GEORGE: You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
MIKE: I'm not sneaking. I didn't even know you were parking, you were just sitting there three spaces up.
GEORGE: Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
MIKE: Well that's the way I park. Anyway, you didn't start backing in until I pulled in.
GEORGE: I was in the middle of a conversation.
MIKE: Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?
GEORGE: The point is I was here first.
MIKE: I was closer to this space than you were.
GEORGE: But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
MIKE: I can if I have room!
GEORGE: Are you gonna move the car?
MIKE: No, I'm not gonna move the car.
GEORGE: Jerk!
MIKE: Oh, you're not?
GEORGE: Do you believe this guy?
ELAINE: Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
GEORGE: I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
ELAINE: What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
GEORGE: Are you coming back down?
ELAINE: Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
GEORGE: Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
ELAINE: Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
GEORGE: Oh, come on, you're good at this.
ELAINE: What am I gonna say?
GEORGE: I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
(Elaine heads upstairs. Mike honks his horn, George honks his in retaliation.)
[Cut to Jerry's apartment. Jerry is moving chairs, Elaine bursts in.]
ELAINE: Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
JERRY: Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
ELAINE: Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
JERRY: (bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
ELAINE: (after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
JERRY: He is?
ELAINE: Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
JERRY: A gun?!
ELAINE: I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
JERRY: My god, are you okay?
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
JERRY: Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
ELAINE: Exactly.
JERRY: Where's George now?
ELAINE: Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
JERRY: What are you talking about?
ELAINE: Look out the window, you'll see.
JERRY: (leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
GEORGE: Hey!
JERRY: Are you okay?
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm fine.
JERRY: Crazy kids, huh?
GEORGE: What?
ELAINE: (desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
MIKE: Is that Jerry? Jerry?!
JERRY: Oh, hey Mike.
GEORGE: What, you know Jerry?
MIKE: Yeah, I know Jerry.
GEORGE: How do you know him?
MIKE: What's the difference?
GEORGE: Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
MIKE: Well, bully for you. Hey, Jerry! You know your friend here's a real piece of work!
JERRY: I'm coming down.
MIKE: Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?
GEORGE: What, you know Kramer?!
(Kramer walks into Jerry's apartment.)
ELAINE: Hi.
KRAMER: (acting standoffish) Hello.
JERRY: Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
KRAMER: (out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
GEORGE: And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
MIKE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Oh great.
ELAINE: You know that guy downstairs?
JERRY: Yeah, he's a real phony.
KRAMER: What's going on?!
MIKE: Hey, will you come on down? This guy's in my space!
GEORGE: It's my space!
KRAMER: I'll be down in a minute.
ELAINE: Are you going down?
KRAMER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Is anything wrong?
KRAMER: (leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
ELAINE: (heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
(Jerry grabs his jacket and walks out the door.)
MIKE: Hey pal, you're not getting that space. I mean, I'll sleep in my car if I have to.
GEORGE: I'll die out here.
(Two bystanders are discussing the incident. )
BYSTANDER #1: He was down there. Once he passed his front bumper, it's no longer his space.
BYSTANDER #2: No, it doesn't matter. He was-
MIKE: Hey! Jerry! Long time no see!
JERRY: Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
MIKE: Hey Krame! You know this guy?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I know him.
MIKE: (to Jerry) You're looking tremendous. What are you on some kind of regimen?
JERRY: Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
MIKE: (laughing way too loud and hard) Ha ha ha ha!!! That's killer! Killer! I love that! Ha ha ha!!! You gotta use that, that's a definite!! Ha ha ha!!!
GEORGE: Oh, come on.
MIKE: Hey! Your friend here has some real problems.
GEORGE: Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
MIKE: Hey, just 'cause I went in front first doesn't mean I'm sneaking in.
GEORGE: You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
MIKE: I only went in front first 'cause I could make it in front first and if you pull out I'll show you!
GEORGE: You've got a prayer.
KRAMER: I go in front first all the time.
JERRY: Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
(Elaine shows up and pulls George aside.)
GEORGE: Did you talk to him?
ELAINE: Yeah, it's all taken care of.
GEORGE: You told him? What did you tell him?
ELAINE: I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
GEORGE: I don't believe it, what did you say?
ELAINE: I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
GEORGE: A pack of teenagers?
ELAINE: Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
GEORGE: You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
ELAINE: What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
(Elaine and George rejoin the others.)
KRAMER: By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
ELAINE: What?
KRAMER: Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
GEORGE: Oh great.
JERRY: I didn't know.
ELAINE: Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
GEORGE: Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
MIKE: A flea market? You went to a flea market??
GEORGE: Hey, who's talking to you?
ELAINE: We just didn't think of you.
KRAMER: You said it, sister.
GEORGE: What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
(People forget. Look at "Home Alone". They forgot.)
GEORGE: Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
JERRY: I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
GEORGE: Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
JERRY: You're right. My fault.
ELAINE: Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm sorry.
KRAMER: I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
GEORGE: What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
JERRY: It was a so-so sorry.
(A delivery truck pulls up and honks. The driver leans out of the cab.)
TRUCK DRIVER: Hey! Move this car, I gotta get through!
GEORGE: You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
MIKE: And like you're not gonna just back it in if I do that?
TRUCK DRIVER: Well somebody better move something soon! I got a truck full of ice cream here!
ELAINE: You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
JERRY: Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
ELAINE: Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
GEORGE: Uh huh.
JERRY: Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
GEORGE: Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
ELAINE: Right.
GEORGE: I learned a lot about myself.
JERRY: What did you do to my car?!
GEORGE: I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
ELAINE: Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
JERRY: I thought you said you were a good driver!
GEORGE: No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
JERRY: I think you said driver.
GEORGE: Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
MIKE: Will you move it up a little bit?
GEORGE: No no no, that's in the right position.
MIKE: No no, I was further in.
GEORGE: No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
MIKE: Do you mind?
GEORGE: Do you?
SID: Hey, somebody better move these cars, you're making a commotion.
JERRY: Hey Sid.
MIKE: Who are you?
SID: Never mind who I am. I know who I am. Do you know who you are? (to George) Why is it every time you park a car in this block, everything gets disrupted and disjointed?
GEORGE: Sid, it's completely his fault.
MIKE: Oh, right.
SID: Why don't you start taking the bus?
JERRY: Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
GEORGE: Don't do it!
JERRY: What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
GEORGE: Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
ELAINE: Why don't you just flip a coin already?
GEORGE: No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
ELAINE: You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
GEORGE: So you're against me now?
(An old man and Matthew, the boy who's father owns the 'fat free' frozen yogurt store, are discussing the incident.)
ANGRY MAN: He could have pulled up to the car and backed in, but he chose to go in head first.
MATTHEW: No he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.
ANGRY MAN: No he wasn't.
MATTHEW: All that matters is who was there first.
ANGRY MAN: Ahh, you're not even old enough to drive, you little puke.
MATTHEW: You just spit on me!
ANGRY MAN: Don't you raise your voice to me!
MATTHEW: You're not my father.
JERRY: Hey Matthew.
MATTHEW: Hi Jerry. This guy's really a jerk.
JERRY: How ya doing?
MATTHEW: Okay.
JERRY: Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
MATTHEW: What?!
JERRY: Oh no, nothing.
MATTHEW: What's happened to daddy? He's going out of business?
JERRY: No, no, no, no.
MATTHEW: We're not going to have any money? We're out of money?
JERRY: No, of course not, of course not!
MATTHEW: Mommy!? Jerry says daddy's closing the store. He's going out of business. We don't have any money?
MARYEDITH: Jerry?! What's the matter with you?
JERRY: I didn't--
MARYEDITH: (to Kramer) Boy, I don't know about your friend, Jerry. He says some pretty stupid things sometimes.
KRAMER: Oh, congratulations.
MARYEDITH: What for?
KRAMER: Well, you're pregnant.
MARYEDITH: What?
KRAMER: You're not pregnant?
MARYEDITH: No, I'm not pregnant.
KRAMER: Are you sure you're not pregnant?
MARYEDITH: Yes, I'm sure!
KRAMER: That's weird.
MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew.
MATTHEW: No.
MARYEDITH: Come on, Matthew!
KRAMER: I thought she was pregnant.
JERRY: (to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: Mike thinks I'm a phony.
ELAINE: He thinks you're a phony?
JERRY: Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
ELAINE: Oh, you have to say something.
JERRY: I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
ELAINE: You gotta open the vault.
JERRY: Open my vault?
ELAINE: Open your vault.
JERRY: Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
ELAINE: You have no choice.
JERRY: Oy ga-vault.
Newman: (to Kramer) You wanna know why you can't go in front first? I'll tell you why. because it signals a breakdown in the social order. Chaos. It reduces us to jungle law.
(George begins applauding.)
KRAMER: When can you park head first?
NEWMAN: Never.
MIKE: What are you asking this guy for?
NEWMAN: Who's talking to you?
GEORGE: He's right. never.
MIKE: Oh yeah? What if you got ten car lengths? You have to pull all the way up to the front car?
NEWMAN: Well, I suppose if you got ten car lengths.
GEORGE: When do you ever have ten car lengths?
KRAMER: What about Sundays and holidays?
GEORGE: Oh please.
(A passerby (Sheila) stops and asks George)
SHEILA: What's going on here?
GEORGE: Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
SHEILA: I really hate people who do that. I hope you don't let him get away with it.
GEORGE: Well, thank you for your support.
SHEILA: Hey, that's a great hat.
GEORGE: Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
NEWMAN: Hey George, nice hat.
GEORGE: Yeah, thanks.
NEWMAN: Can I try it on?
GEORGE: No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
NEWMAN: Well sure it would.
GEORGE: No! Get out of here, Newman.
NEWMAN: Come on, let me try it on.
GEORGE: No, Newman, stop it.
SHEILA: Let him try it on.
GEORGE: I don't want him to!
SHEILA: What is wrong with you?
GEORGE: You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
NEWMAN: Stop it, George, stop it. I was defending your parking.
GEORGE: Alright, just keep the hat!
JERRY: Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
ELAINE: It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
KRAMER: I'm not going if he's going.
NEWMAN: Me either.
GEORGE: I'm not going if he's going.
MIKE: Well I'm going.
JERRY: Well if he's going then I'm not going.
NEWMAN: But it's your house.
JERRY: I still don't have to go.
ELAINE: Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
MIKE: Why won't you go if I go?
JERRY: Why? I'll tell you why.
KRAMER: No. Don't, Jerry.
JERRY: Like you didn't call me a phony?
MIKE: What? (to Kramer) Thanks! Real good! Jerry! First of all, I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complementary way. I mean, you know when people say, 'He's bad', it really means he's good, sort of thing? You know, slang.
JERRY: Use it in a sentence.
MIKE: Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. (to Kramer) Why'd you tell him?!?
KRAMER: He begged me.
MIKE: He begged you?!
JERRY: Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
(Two police officers walk up.)
COP #1: Okay, who's cars are these? Let's move 'em. Let's go.
GEORGE: Officer, could I just explain something to you?
COP #1: Hey. Let's go or I'm gonna write both of you a ticket in about two minutes.
GEORGE: Officer, he can't pull in head first.
MIKE: Officer, he backed up from down the street. He was doub
