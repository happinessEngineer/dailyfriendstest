I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
RHISA: No, they caught him.
GEORGE: (running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
FRANKIE: (seeing George running away) Ohh...
[Monk's]
ELAINE: So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
JACK: Elaine, that's the second piece of good news today.
ELAINE: Really, what was the first?
JACK: (pulling out his Wiz hat) They're bringing me back. Yeah. I'm the Wiz again.
ELAINE: What?
JACK: (dancing around) I'm the Wiz! I'm the Wiz!
ELAINE: Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
JACK: (dancing around) Oh... here's a fact. Uh, I'm... the Wiz! I'm the Wiz and noooobody beats me!
[The Woods]
JERRY: (finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
FRANKIE: You hate the van.
JERRY: But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
FRANKIE: So, can we go for a ride?
JERRY: Yeah, let's just get out of here.
HOLE DIGGER #2: (eyeing the empty hole, and getting into it) Are you done with that?
[Another Part of The Woods]
FRANK: (coming upon the van) Good. He left the door unlocked.
ESTELLE: Why did Kramer have to park the van in the woods?
FRANK: Isn't it obvious? There are no parking meters out here.
ESTELLE: (looking inside of the van) Wow!
FRANK: (reclining the seats in the van to a bed) Hey, look at this. Hoochie mama!
[Post Office]
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Oh, my goodness. What have they done to you here?
KRAMER: Huh? Who are you?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Well, you can just call me Henry.
KRAMER: Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Last time I checked.
KRAMER: Henry... can I get out of here now?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Oh, oh. Sit a bit. Sit a bit. I mean, after all, I drove all the way up here from D.C. just to talk to you.
KRAMER: Oh?
POSTMASTER GENERAL: I even had to cancel a round of golf with the secretary of state. Do you like golf, Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER: Yeah.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Kramer, I've been, uh, reading some of your material here. I gotta be honest with you: you make a pretty strong case. I mean, just imagine. An army of men in wool pants running through the neighborhood handing out pottery catalogs, door to door.
KRAMER: Yeah! Ha ha.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Well, it's my job. And I'm pretty damn serious about it. In addition to being a postmaster, I'm a general. And we both know, it's the job of a general to, by God, get things done. So maybe you can understand why I get a little irritated when someone calls me away from my golf.
KRAMER: I'm very, very sorry.
POSTMASTER GENERAL: Sure, you're sorry. I think we got a stack of mail out at the desk that belongs to you. Now, you want that mail, don't you Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER: Sure do!
POSTMASTER GENERAL: (receiving a salute from Kramer) Now, that's better.
KRAMER: (seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
NEWMAN: (whimpering) Tell the world my story.
[The Woods]
JERRY: Hey, George!
GEORGE: Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
JERRY: What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.
GEORGE: Oh. The summer me.
FRANKIE: The winter me.
JERRY: You must be George's cousin.
RHISA: Girlfriend.
JERRY: All right.
GEORGE: (seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
JERRY: Don't go a-knockin'.
ESTELLE: (after George opens the van door) Oh, my god!
GEORGE: (seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
FRANKIE: Now you gotta sell this van.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
[Costanza House]
FRANK: What you saw in that van was a natural expression of a man's love for his lady.
GEORGE: Ohhhh...
ESTELLE: Your father's right. It's beautiful.
FRANK: And it was safe.
GEORGE: Oh, God...
FRANK: Now if you'll excuse me. Once again, your mother and I...
GEORGE: Oh... make it stop.
[Jerry and Kramer walking along on the sidewalk]
JERRY: I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
KRAMER: Well what's the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
JERRY: Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
(there is a light pole, so Jerry puts his hand on it and swings gently around it and keeps walking)
KRAMER: No he didn't. They were in business together… it was dry wall, or somethin'.
JERRY: Oh, no.
KRAMER: All right then, what was it?
JERRY: Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
KRAMER: The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
JERRY: Ya broke my blender, didn't ya?
KRAMER: Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didn't work out.
JERRY: I knew it.
[Jerry and Kramer still walking along the sidewalk talking]
JERRY: Why were you making gravel?
KRAMER: Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
(Jerry and Kramer see a huge dumpster in an alley)
KRAMER: Aahh, this looks familiar…
JERRY: Of course. It's garbage.
KRAMER: No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
JERRY: Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
KRAMER: Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
JERRY: Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
KRAMER: No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
JERRY: (moans) Ohhh (walks away)
[In George's car]
GEORGE: You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
MIRANDA: Banana?
GEORGE: Right.
MIRANDA: George watch out for those pigeons.
GEORGE: Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
(George hits the pigeons. As the feathers fly, Miranda is frantic.)
MIRANDA: (gasp) Oh my God. (trying to catch her breath, she puts her hand to her chest.)
GEORGE: So uh… where we eating?
(Miranda takes a couple more breaths)
[Celia's apartment]
JERRY: And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
CELIA: You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.
JERRY: Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys)
CELIA: Oh yeah the toys.
JERRY: Where did you get all these?
CELIA: My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from a long painful bout with…
JERRY: Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
CELIA: Jerry, what are you doing?
JERRY: I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
CELIA: Ohhh Jerry. (takes them from Jerry and puts them back with the other toys) They're priceless. They've never been played with.
JERRY: I just want a, touch 'em a little.
CELIA: I said no. Now come here.
(They embrace in a kiss with eyes closed. Jerry opens his eyes looking at all the toys)
[Peterman's]
(Elaine in the kitchen, is getting some coffee and turns around from the counter, lou is standing way too close)
LOU: Hi (startled, Elaine spills her coffee on her sleeve) I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here.
(Lou turns and walks away. Walter enters the kitchen)
ELAINE: Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
WALTER: uh-He's Lou Filerman. He's new here.
ELAINE: (exhales)
WALTER: Hey your coffee stain looks like Fidel Castro.
ELAINE: You've been an enormous help.
[Monk's]
JERRY: You ran over some pigeons? How many?
GEORGE: What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
JERRY: Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
GEORGE: Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
JERRY: So Miranda's cooled on ya?
GEORGE: I'm getting nothing.
JERRY: Yeah, me neither.
GEORGE: Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
JERRY: Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
(Elaine enters)
GEORGE: I don't understand women.
JERRY: Here comes one.
ELAINE: Hey. What's going on?
GEORGE: Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
ELAINE: No, Castro.
GEORGE: Right.
ELAINE: All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
JERRY: So he just sidles up?
ELAINE: That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
JERRY: Maybe you just didn't see him.
ELAINE: Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
JERRY: Hakuna Matata?
ELAINE: I thought I was alone.
JERRY: That doesn't make it right.
[Jerry and Elaine walking in the hallway up to Jerry's apartment door]
JERRY: See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
ELAINE: Would you just, let it go?
KRAMER: (from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
(Jerry and Elaine head into Kramer's apartment. There is a large blue, spangly curtain through which they enter)
KRAMER: Hey! (moving a chair onto the set)
JERRY: Oh my God!
KRAMER: (Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
JERRY: How did you get this in here?
KRAMER: Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
JERRY: So where you gonna sleep?
KRAMER: Yeah ... backstage.
ELAINE: Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
KRAMER: (putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
(phone rings)
JERRY: I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
KRAMER: All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if he's reaching out a good-bye)
(Jerry turns and looks at Kramer like he's nuts. The phone rings again and Jerry exits)
KRAMER: Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that you're even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
ELAINE: (giggles)
[Central Park]
(George watches a jogger running through a bunch of pigeons and they scatter. George runs at the pigeons. They don't move for him and he steps on one - feathers fly everywhere)
GEORGE: Ahh, Ah-Ah…We had a deal!
(a mother and son sitting on a park bench are horrified witnessing what just happened in front of them)
[Peterman's Office]
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
PETERMAN: One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article on the most fascinating people of the year. Annnnnd, done. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I needed this so quickly (leafing through the pages). It must have been an awful lot of work. Thank you very much, you two.
ELAINE: What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and… )
(Lou Filerman is standing behind her)
[Kramer's Apartment - The Merv Griffin set]
JERRY: So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
KRAMER: Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
JERRY: Yeah, that was me.
KRAMER: Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an…
JERRY: An Army Pete.
KRAMER: Right.
JERRY: He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
KRAMER: And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Jerry. Oh there - -
KRAMER: Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
ELAINE: (clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
KRAMER: Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
ELAINE: Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
KRAMER: Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
ELAINE: Kramer, what is wrong with you?
KRAMER: What do you mean?
ELAINE: Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
(Kramer puts the note cards inside his jacket)
ELAINE: (to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
JERRY: You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
ELAINE: Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
KRAMER: (to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
GEORGE: Jerry?
(George enters)
KRAMER: Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
(George looks confused. Kramer motions for Jerry and Elaine to move down another seat to make room for the new guest George. Kramer points, laughs, claps and pats George on the back)
TAPE RECORDER: Turn Music Off (Kramer pushes the off button turning the music off)
KRAMER: Yeah, sit, sit, sit… Weeell! (laughing, clapping)
GEORGE: Well, it happened again.
JERRY: What happened?
KRAMER: Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?
GEORGE: Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
KRAMER: All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
(Confused, Jerry and Elaine look at each other while George stares at Kramer.)
KRAMER: That was the wrong card.
GEORGE: I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
JERRY: So they're like everyone else.
KRAMER: (laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
(George, Elaine and Jerry sit there watching - fascinated, as Kramer munches on some chips, sits back, takes a drink of soda, sets the can down, burps and adjusts his tie)
KRAMER: … Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!
[George's Car]
GEORGE: Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
MIRANDA: Then why don't you just run IT over too?
GEORGE: Zing.
(George sees a lone pigeon in the middle of the road - shot of George's worried face - back to the pigeon, as the car is almost on top of it and still not moving out of the way. George swerves the car to avoid hitting the pigeon. George pulls the car over and stops)
MIRANDA: George, what are you doing?
GEORGE: Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
MIRANDA: What pigeon? You drove right into that squirrel. (leaves the car)
GEORGE: Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
[Celia's Apartment]
(Jerry and Celia are getting comfortable, sitting on the couch, watching TV. Jerry reaches over to the shelves with all the toys and picks up a plastic army man and pretends like he's shooting another plastic army man)
JERRY: (sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
(Celia sees Jerry playing)
CELIA: Jerry! (she slides away from him) … Those hands! They never stop!
JERRY: I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
CELIA: No. Thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
JERRY: All right.
(Jerry gets up and walks to the bathroom - Opens the medicine cabinet, picks up a pill bottle, reading the label)
JERRY: Ohh, will not "cause drowsiness"
(picks up another bottle) May "cause…drowsiness"
(Jerry puts the first bottle back and takes the second one)
[Peterman's office]
LOU: Here's the new copy you wanted.
PETERMAN: Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. In record time. I'm very impressed ... with both of you.
(Elaine is quietly standing behind Lou - she sidled him)
ELAINE: (winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
PETERMAN: Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent drivel! This is a total redo. And I'm assuming I need it right away.
ELAINE: Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
[Celia's apartment ]
(Celia is passed out sleeping. Camera pans to a toy monkey going full speed. Jerry is playing with the original G.I. Joe in the full frogman suit. He pretends the G.I. Joe is swimming into the monkey - and beats the monkey, making it fall off the coffee table)
JERRY: Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer… A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
[Veterinary Clinic]
MIRANDA: Doctor is the squirrel going to live?
DOCTOR: There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to save him but, it would be costly, difficult and we'd have to send away for some special really tiny instruments.
GEORGE: Well, uh, are there any other options?
DOCTOR: We, could put him to sleep.
GEORGE: What might that cost?
DOCTOR: Well it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents.
GEORGE: Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
DOCTOR: He, um. He's not going to be the same, you know?
GEORGE: Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
[Kramer's Apartment - The Merv Griffin set]
GEORGE: So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
KRAMER: El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
NEWMAN: (laughs - T-heheheheheheheh) El Paso!
(Kramer is now laughing cause Newman is laughing)
JERRY: What's he here for?
NEWMAN: eue-aaa.
KRAMER: Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
JERRY: Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
KRAMER: Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
NEWMAN: Are you married right now? (points at Jerry)
KRAMER: Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans' arm)
JERRY: Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
KRAMER: What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
JERRY: She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
GEORGE: Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
KRAMER: Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
NEWMAN: I told you he was a risk.
JERRY: Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
NEWMAN: Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these chairs!
KRAMER: Smile, everyone! We're back!
[Elaine's office]
LOU: You wanted to see me, Elaine?
ELAINE: Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
LOU: My dead tooth?
ELAINE: No. Your. (breathes)
LOU: Not my breath?
ELAINE: Uuhhh.
LOU: What can I do?
ELAINE: Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
LOU: Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! (he opens the door and goes into the hall - now he clicks and clacks when he walks)
(Elaine smiles, nodding her head, thinking she has fixed Lou's Sidling ability)
[Celia's apartment]
GEORGE: More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
CELIA: Hmm. (takes a sip)
JERRY: So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought: ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
CELIA: What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
JERRY and GEORGE: Tryptophan.* (*footnote - see end of script)
CELIA: Ahh.
JERRY: ... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
CELIA: What video did you get?
GEORGE: Oh.
JERRY: Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
GEORGE: Four hours.
JERRY: More heavy gravy?
(Celia is sleeping )
GEORGE: (playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
[Kramer's Apartment - The Merv Griffin set]
NEWMAN: Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic brand of waxed beans. You know, I rip of the label… I can hardly tell the difference.
KRAMER: We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
NEWMAN: We got no one!
KRAMER: We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
(Kramer pulls the plug, hitting Newman in the process, and the show goes dark -Kramer exhales as they sit there for 7 seconds, silently, thinking )
NEWMAN: What about a guest-host?
KRAMER: I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
[Veterinary Clinic]
MIRANDA: Doctor, how's the squirrel?
GEORGE: Is he dead?
DOCTOR: No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just in time. Would you like to visit him?
MIRANDA: Yes he would.
(The Vet opens the door to the room with the squirrel laying on the bed. George is standing in the doorway, then takes a few steps to the bed as the doctor moves to the door.)
DOCTOR: You uh, You have 30 minutes. (Doctor exits. George turns and looks towards the doctor)
GEORGE: So ... uh, squirrel.
(Doctor enters)
DOCTOR: One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what time you'll be picking him up tomorrow.
GEORGE: What's that?
DOCTOR: Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better off at home.
GEORGE: He has no home. He's a squirrel.
DOCTOR: Hmm-hm. Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his medicine six times a day and keep his tail elevated. (exits)
[Monk's]
JERRY: Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
GEORGE: It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
JERRY: What about my "questionable material"?
KRAMER: Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
JERRY: Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
KRAMER: Well, I practically raised his kids.
GEORGE: That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
KRAMER: What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
GEORGE: I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think I've got that problem, solved.
JERRY: Tic-Tacs work?
ELAINE: He's a human maraca.
GEORGE: Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
ELAINE: You took him over to Celia's?
JERRY: What? It's a victimless crime.
ELAINE: What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
JERRY: Okay, one victim.
ELAINE: I think it's unconscionable.
GEORGE: Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
ELAINE: EZ Bake oven?
[Celia's apartment]
(Celia at the dinner table, passed out again. We hear a ding from the EZ Bake Oven. Elaine, Jerry and George are sitting on the floor around the coffee table full of toys.)
ELAINE: Who wants cupcake?
GEORGE: Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
JERRY: You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
FRANK: (on TV) You step on it and it flushes.
ELAINE: Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
ESTELLE: (on TV) Stop squirming.
GEORGE: Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
JERRY: You're like eight years old.
ESTELLE: (on TV) Georgie.
GEORGE: I was seven and a half.
[Elaine's office]
(Elaine is shaking some Tic Tacs into her hand)
PETERMAN: That noise. That's the noise!
ELAINE: What?
PETERMAN: That infernal rattling sound that has plagued me these past two days - and I could not find the source. In my office, in the hallway. Even in the men's room! Shame on you, Elaine!
ELAINE: No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
PETERMAN: That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! You haven't gone over to their side have you?
ELAINE: No Mister Peterman.
PETERMAN: Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your out on your can. And if you are undead - I'll find out about that too. (Exits)
(Elaine hears the click-clack click-clack rattling of the Tic-Tacs in the hall - she searches for the source of the sound)
[Coffee room]
ELAINE: (pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
LOU: Oh, right.
ELAINE: (Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
LOU: Why?
ELAINE: Because they're turning your teeth green?
LOU: I only buy the white ones.
ELAINE: O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
LOU: I can't. It burns my cankers.
ELAINE: Binaca?
LOU: Again.
ELAINE: Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
LOU: I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey Mouse gumball machine. They stopped making that 20 years ago.
ELAINE: Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
[Kramer's Apartment - The Merv Griffin set]
KRAMER: Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
FOWLER: Where are the cameras? (he has a live Hawk perched on his arm)
KRAMER: But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
JERRY: It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
KRAMER: And she doesn't know anything, about this?
JERRY: No, not a thing.
(Newman laughs)
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
(just like the "The Jerry Springer Show")
CELIA: What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
NEWMAN & KRAMER: Woah.
JERRY: What, What is this? What is she doing here?
KRAMER: It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
CELIA: If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you got another thing coming, buddy!
NEWMAN: Go girl!
JERRY: Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
NEWMAN and KRAMER: Ohhh!
(George enters with the squirrel)
GEORGE: Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
KRAMER: George I told you we're booked!
FOWLER: Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
(the Hawk starts making squawking sounds)
KRAMER: Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
GEORGE: Uh.
FOWLER: No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!
(in slow motion - the hawk flies straight at George and the squirrel. Then a shot of Jerry looking amazed, Kramer looking stunned, Newman totally amused. Then the screeching hawk, again in slow motion, coming right at George. George puts his crossed arms up in front of him)
GEORGE: Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!
KRAMER: (off camera) Are we getting this?
[Monk's]
(George has some scratches on his forehead)
JERRY: So the whole set was destroyed?
KRAMER: Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
GEORGE: Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry 'bout the set.
KRAMER: I'll tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
MIRANDA: I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. (exits)
JERRY: So the squirrel's gonna make it?
GEORGE: Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm… sleeping on the couch.
JERRY: On the couch? So you're...
GEORGE: Still getting nothing!
(George sees some pigeons outside the window, making pigeon noises)
GEORGE: So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
[Celia's]
CELIA: I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to someone.
ELAINE: Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
CELIA: Who's he? (Lou)
ELAINE: Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celia's glass)
(Merv Griffin Show theme music plays)
[Elaine wakes up in bed with Jerry.]
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Morning.
ELAINE: Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
JERRY: But why?
ELAINE: I need some space.
(Elaine turns to the other side and there's George.)
GEORGE: Does that mean I have to go too?
JERRY: You don't think she's just talking to me?
GEORGE: Hey, shut up.
JERRY: You shut up.
ELAINE: I hate this.
(Kramer pops out the covers.)
KRAMER: You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
ELAINE: No, I don't want this anymore.
JERRY: We'll come to work with you.
GEORGE: And on your dates.
JERRY: And shopping.
KRAMER: And to the bathroom.
JERRY, GEORGE & KRAMER: Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)
ELAINE: I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
(Elaine tries to push her alarm clock showing 3:30. She realizes, that alarm comes from next door.)
ELAINE: (Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
[Mr. Kruger's office. Kruger is reading George's CV.]
KRUGER: Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?
GEORGE: Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
KRUGER: It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days?
GEORGE: That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
KRUGER: George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but what the hell, we need someone, huh.
GEORGE: You won't regret this, sir.
KRUGER: I don't care. Let's find you an office.
(Kruger leaves and George notices a photograph on the table: Kruger's family and George on the background.)
[Monk's cafe. Jerry, George and Kramer.]
GEORGE:...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
JERRY: The boom box incident?
GEORGE: Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
JERRY: Seems reasonable.
GEORGE: Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
JERRY: Even more reasonable.
GEORGE: So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
JERRY: And that guy is your new boss?
GEORGE: Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
KRAMER: Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
JERRY: Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
GEORGE: It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
KRAMER: You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
GEORGE: Like retouched.
KRAMER: You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
GEORGE: Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
(George leaves. Kramer tries to eat a sandwich and it brakes in to his hands.)
KRAMER: Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
(Kramer tosses Jerry's sandwich around.)
KRAMER: I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
JERRY: Neither have I.
[5A. Kramer is slicing meat with a meat slicer. Jerry comes in.]
KRAMER: Hey, our meat problems are solved.
JERRY: Where did you get this thing?
KRAMER: I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
(Elaine comes in.)
ELAINE: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
ELAINE: Yeah, that's pretty good.
JERRY: Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
ELAINE: Sara Sitarides?
JERRY: Mmhu.
ELAINE: Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
JERRY: What's with you?
ELAINE: You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
JERRY: Your whole building smells like potatoes.
ELAINE: This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3:30 this morning.
KRAMER: You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
ELAINE: How do you do that?
KRAMER: Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
JERRY: I think we might have one left in the stock room.
(Kramer looks lost.)
[Elaine's building. Elaine and Kramer.]
KRAMER: This hallway smells like potatoes.
ELAINE: I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
KRAMER: Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
ELAINE: I think I'll let you do it.
KRAMER: No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
ELAINE: No, I really don't want to.
KRAMER: Well, I don't want to either.
ELAINE: I thought you had done this before.
KRAMER: It's just...it's no picnic.
ELAINE: Well, how are we gonna do it?
KRAMER: Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
(Kramer moisturizes the paper clip in his mouth and sticks it to the power socket. Electric buzz and Kramer twitches on the floor. The lights go off.)
KRAMER: Oh mama.
ELAINE: Are you okay?
KRAMER: I will lose that nail.
[Monk's cafe. Jerry and Dr. Sara Sitarides.]
SARA: I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what it's like to have someone's life depending on you.
JERRY: Well, I have this neighbor...
SARA: A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's life?
JERRY: Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
SARA: No.
JERRY: Cause I hit a whopper last week!
[Flash Foto. George is picking up the photo.]
CLERK: Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky.
(George looks at the picture and he is still there, but Kruger isn't.)
GEORGE: What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
CLERK: I thought you said you wanted to be out?
GEORGE: Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
CLERK: You've really lost a lot of hair.
GEORGE: I am aware!
[Elaine's apartment. She is reading a catalog on her bed.]
Elaine thinking: Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book.
(She hears a loud cat meowing next door.)
ELAINE: The cat.
[5A, Jerry, George and Kramer.]
JERRY: He took out Kruger?
GEORGE: I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
(Kramer cuts meat wearing a white coat.)
KRAMER: This slicer is indomitable.
JERRY: Where did you get that butcher's coat?
KRAMER: You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
(Elaine comes in.)
ELAINE: Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
KRAMER: See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
ELAINE: What did he do about it?
KRAMER: Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
ELAINE: Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
KRAMER: Oh, that's a prickly one.
ELAINE: Yeah, how's the doctor date?
JERRY: Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
ELAINE: Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
JERRY: Dermatology?
ELAINE: Yes, she's a dermatologist.
JERRY: Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
KRAMER: The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
ELAINE: Where are we going?
KRAMER: The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
(Elaine and Kramer leave.)
GEORGE: When are you going on your next date with her?
JERRY: Oh, what's the point?
GEORGE: What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
JERRY: Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
GEORGE: This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
JERRY: Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
GEORGE: Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
JERRY: You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
GEORGE: No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
JERRY: Flowers?
GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
JERRY: So, you've done this?
GEORGE: Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
[Elaine's hallway. Kramer and Elaine are sizing the space under the door.]
KRAMER: I think we are looking half a millimeter.
ELAINE: Can it cut that thin?
KRAMER: Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
ELAINE: How did you know you cut it?
KRAMER: Well, I guess I just assumed.
ELAINE: Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
KRAMER: Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
ELAINE: Alright, let's do it.
KRAMER: Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
ELAINE: Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
KRAMER: Oh no, I don't think so.
ELAINE: Why not?
KRAMER: Well, you're not checked at on it.
ELAINE: What do I have to know?
KRAMER: Well, where the meat goes?
ELAINE: Right there.
KRAMER: Where do you turn it on?
ELAINE: Right there.
KRAMER: But where does the meat go?
[Jerry is on the revenge date with Sara.]
SARA: Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice.
JERRY: Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
SARA: It's fine.
JERRY: It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
SARA: What is with you?
JERRY: You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
(A man comes to the table.)
PARRY: Dr. Sitarides?
SARA: Mr. Parry, how are you?
PARRY: I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life.
JERRY: She saved your life?
PARRY: I had skin cancer.
JERRY: Skin cancer! Damn.
[Elaine's apartment. She is opening letters with the slicer and talking on the phone.]
ELAINE: You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
(Walks off the couch.)
ELAINE: These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
[Flash foto. George is picking up the photo.]
CLERK: Here you Mr. Costanza.
(George looks at the photo. Mr. Kruger has been drawn in to the picture.)
GEORGE: What is this? This is a drawing.
CLERK: Looks real, doesn't it?
GEORGE: This is a cartoon!
CLERK: Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think that's damn good.
GEORGE: But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
CLERK: Then you better get a camera.
[5A, George is showing Jerry the picture.]
JERRY: He looks like a Peanuts character.
GEORGE: I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
JERRY: You can do that.
GEORGE: Without his shirt on.
JERRY: You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
GEORGE: It seemed so disorganized.
JERRY: I understand.
GEORGE: What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
JERRY: True. You mean, for you?
GEORGE: I think.
JERRY: What about your sea sickness?
GEORGE: Maybe I could be a land guy.
JERRY: I don't know if they have land guys.
GEORGE: Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
(Elaine comes in.)
ELAINE: Pliers?
JERRY: Drawer.
ELAINE: Got it.
JERRY: What are they for?
ELAINE: I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
JERRY: Come again?
ELAINE: Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
GEORGE: I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
JERRY: Eh, it went okay.
GEORGE: Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
JERRY: Yeah, I started out real classy...
GEORGE: Yeah you did, you classed it up!
JERRY: But then I found out about the skin cancer.
GEORGE: Oh, so it backfired?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
ELAINE: Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
JERRY: Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
GEORGE: Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
ELAINE: Aha.
GEORGE: Could she do that at Kruger?
ELAINE: I don't know, I guess.
GEORGE: So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
ELAINE: You have a little thing for this fella'?
GEORGE: Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
JERRY: Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
GEORGE: And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
JERRY: Must I?
GEORGE: Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
JERRY: How does that reflect me?
(Kramer comes in.)
KRAMER: Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
ELAINE: Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
KRAMER: Ok, I'll go with you.
ELAINE: Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
KRAMER: Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
[Jerry and Sara at Sara's office.]
JERRY: So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
SARA: Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off.
JERRY: Was it pimple popper MD?
SARA: That's the one. (Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.)
JERRY: Still got it.
[Elaine is trying to get the shoe heal off the slicer.]
ELAINE: Out, damn heal!
(Knock on the door.)
KRAMER: Elaine?
ELAINE: Kramer?
KRAMER: Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
ELAINE: Just hold on!
(Elaine bangs the slicer to the door.)
KRAMER: Hey, what's going on?
ELAINE: Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
(Elaine closes the door and Kramer checks the slices.)
KRAMER: My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
ELAINE: Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
KRAMER: Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
NEIGHBOR: Hey, get the hell out of here!
KRAMER: Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.
[5A. Jerry and Kramer.]
KRAMER: So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
(Jerry comes and shows Kramer his neck, which has red spots all over it.)
JERRY: What the hell is this?
KRAMER: Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
JERRY: No.
KRAMER: Well, what have you been doing?
JERRY: Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
KRAMER: Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
JERRY: Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
KRAMER: There, there's your hives.
JERRY: What, she gave me hives?
KRAMER: Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
JERRY: She did kind of touch my face.
KRAMER: Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
JERRY: It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
KRAMER: Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
[Elaine tries to go to feed the cat, but door knob comes loose to her hand.]
ELAINE: Oh, that's fantastic.
[Kruger's. George and Sara.]
GEORGE: I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
SARA: What record?
GEORGE: His personal file, I, I don't ask...
(Jerry and Kramer walk in.)
SARA: Jerry? What brings you here?
JERRY: I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
SARA: Looks like hives.
JERRY: Where do you suppose that could've come from?
GEORGE: Jerry, what are you doing...
KRAMER: He is just setting the record straight.
JERRY: Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
SARA: Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose?
JERRY: I want the antidote, pimple popper!
SARA: That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane.
JERRY: Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
(Sara leaves and Jerry goes after her.)
GEORGE: Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
(Kruger comes to George and Kramer. Kramer is wearing the white butcher's coat.)
KRUGER: Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here?
GEORGE: Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
KRAMER: Doc, huh?
GEORGE: Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
KRAMER: Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.
GEORGE: And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
KRAMER: You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
GEORGE: Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
[Elaine's bedroom. Cat is meowing next door.]
ELAINE: This is it. I can take this anymore.
(She turns the radio on loud (Foghat: Slow Ride) and "dances" few little kicks.)
[Kruger's. Kramer is examining Mr. Kruger.]
KRAMER: Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
KRUGER: How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand?
KRAMER: Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
KRUGER: So, how am I looking?
KRAMER: Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
(Kramer comes out to talk to George.)
GEORGE: Kramer, I really owe you one.
KRAMER: George, we got a problem.
GEORGE: What?
KRAMER: Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
GEORGE: So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
KRAMER: George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
GEORGE: Because, you're not a dermatologist.
KRAMER: He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
GEORGE: Whoa, whoa, a section?!
KRAMER: Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
GEORGE: No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
KRAMER: It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
GEORGE: No! Absolutely Not!
KRAMER: Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
[Elaine is on the phone and the radio plays music very loud (Iron Butterfly: In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida)]
ELAINE: Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
NEIGHBOR: Turn it off! Turn it off!
ELAINE: I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
NEIGHBOR: Alright, that's it!
ELAINE: Yeah, the address is 78th West...
(Electric buzz and lights go off and music stops.)
NEIGHBOR: Oh, oh mama...
[5A. Jerry and George]
JERRY: So, Kramer pulled it off?
GEORGE: Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
JERRY: Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
GEORGE: Why don't you see someone about it?
JERRY: I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
KRAMER: (Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
GEORGE: You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
KRAMER: George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
GEORGE: You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
KRAMER: I don't want this on my conscience.
GEORGE: I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
KRAMER: Yeah, alright...
JERRY: Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
KRAMER: They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
JERRY: Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
(Kramer cleans the blade with some liquid and a towel.)
KRAMER: Well, that's weird.
JERRY: What are you doing?
KRAMER: Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
JERRY: That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
KRAMER: So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
JERRY: Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
KRAMER: Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
[Kruger's office]
KRUGER: George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy did we take it on the chin last year.
GEORGE: Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
KRUGER: I'm not too worried about it.
GEORGE: Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
KRUGER: George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, eh?
GEORGE: Whatever.
KRUGER: Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear shaped loser.
GEORGE: Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
KRUGER: Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair.
GEORGE: That's what they tell me!
[Jerry, George and Kramer are waiting for the lock smith at the hallway of Elaine's apartment. Kramer is feeding Elaine under the door.[
KRAMER: Do you want more pastrami?
ELAINE: Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
KRAMER: Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
JERRY: I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
GEORGE: He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
JERRY: Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
GEORGE: What did he give you for it.
JERRY: Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
GEORGE: Have to give him time on this hour.
ELAINE: Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
KRAMER: Oh yeah, coming up...
(The final 'Castle Rock' screen shows, then the end credits roll. Scene cuts to the Coffee shop. George, Elaine, and Jerry enter with suitcases. Elaine has a large bandage on her nose. They all sit down at a booth. All three of them are tired, fed up, and angered)
GEORGE: So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
ELAINE: (Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
GEORGE: (Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
GEORGE: Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
(Kramer comes in and sits down at the booth with them)
JERRY: (To George) I said I was sorry.
GEORGE: You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
JERRY: (Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
KRAMER: (Confused) What is up with you two?
GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.
KRAMER: (To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
JERRY: I don't want to talk about it!
KRAMER: (Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
ELAINE: I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
KRAMER: Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
ELAINE: She.. was.
JERRY: 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.

GEORGE: (Losing it) Funny guy!

ELAINE: Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
GEORGE: Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
ELAINE: (Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
GEORGE: Reparations!
ELAINE: Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.

ALL: ..to you!
MAN: Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!
KRAMER: Yeah!
(FDR eyes Kramer evilly, blows out his candles)
ALL: Heyyy, yeahhhh (Clapping).
(FDR leans back, crosses arms and gives Kramer the same look. Kramer reacts nervously)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: NYC Street]
Notice: "TEN MINUTES EARLIER"
(Jerry and George are walking down the street. The opening credits start to show)
GEORGE: Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
JERRY: Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands?
GEORGE: Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
JERRY: Really?
GEORGE: Five' eight. Five' seven.
(Jerry passes Nina, an old girlfriend)
NINA: Jerry?
JERRY: Nina?
NINA: Hi.
JERRY: It's been years!
NINA: Yeah!
JERRY: (Introducing the two) George, this is Nina.
GEORGE: Nice to meet you.
NINA: Nice to meet you, too.
(Nina smiles as she shakes his hand. George raises his eyebrow)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine's apartment building]
Notice: "THREE HOURS EARLIER"
(Elaine's at her mailbox)
ELAINE: (Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
(Scene ends)
[Setting: The Coffee shop]
Notice: "TWO YEARS EARLIER"
(Jerry is sitting at a booth with Nina)
NINA: And they call it the World Wide Web. You can e-mail anyone!
JERRY: (Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?!
NINA: Ah, I gotta go. (Gets up to leave)
JERRY: Ah.
NINA: It's great talkin'
JERRY: Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
(George and Susan enter and sit with Jerry)
GEORGE: How as the date?
JERRY: Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
SUSAN: No.
GEORGE: Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
SUSAN: Ah, George.
GEORGE: (clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
SUSAN: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: Sorry.
SUSAN: Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.
(Kramer runs into Monk's with a snowball)
KRAMER: Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
JERRY: What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
KRAMER: Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monk's) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
(Elaine and Pinter [Peter] enter Monk's, and are greeted)
JERRY: Hi, Elaine.
GEORGE: Hey!
ELAINE: (Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's new apartment]
Notice: "ELEVEN YEARS EARLIER"
(Jerry, carrying a box, is moving in to his apartment for the first time. He meets his across-the-hall neighbor, Kramer)
KRAMER: Oh, hey, how you doing?
JERRY: Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
KRAMER: Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.
JERRY: Oh.
KRAMER: Uh, you need any help, or..?
JERRY: No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
KRAMER: Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose.
JERRY: Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
KRAMER: (quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: (tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
MELISSA: (appearing in the kitchen stark naked) Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.
JERRY: (looking at her) How about that.
MELISSA: (eating the waffles) Mmm-hmm.
[Monk's]
GEORGE: She ate breakfast naked?
JERRY: She didn't even want a napkin.
GEORGE: I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
JERRY: Oh, it's a scene.
GEORGE: It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
JERRY: I don't really have enough room.
GEORGE: (seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
ELAINE: Hey!
PUDDY: Hi.
JERRY: Hey.
PUDDY: (heading towards the bathroom) I got to make a pit stop.
ELAINE: (sitting down in the booth) 'Kay.
JERRY: Back together?
ELAINE: His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
JERRY: Ah...
ELAINE: So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
GEORGE: 'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
ELAINE: He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
JERRY: Why now?
ELAINE: A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
GEORGE: Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
JERRY: Still with the neck hole?
GEORGE: Still upset. Very upset.
ELAINE: What neck hole?
GEORGE: Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
Elaine, becoming board: Faster.
GEORGE: I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
JERRY: A cashmere sweater.
GEORGE: I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
ELAINE: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
ELAINE: Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
JERRY: No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
GEORGE: Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
ELAINE: I really think it's the size of your neck.
GEORGE: It's my head!
ELAINE: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[Peterman's-Bathroom]
ELAINE: Hey.
PEGGY: Hey.
ELAINE: Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
PEGGY: (somewhat sarcastically) Yeah. Great.
(Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the toilet)
[Jerry's apartment]
KRAMER: You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
JERRY: That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
KRAMER: Showering. How long does it take you?
JERRY: Ten minutes.
KRAMER: (seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
ELAINE: Ten minutes.
KRAMER: Let me smell you.
ELAINE: All right. Whiff away.
KRAMER: (after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
ELAINE: (holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
KRAMER: (backing off) OK.
ELAINE: So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
JERRY: So?
ELAINE: So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
JERRY: (seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
ELAINE: (eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
JERRY: Mmm.
KRAMER: Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
[Jerry's Apartment-later]
JERRY: (playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
MELISSA: Do you challenge?
JERRY: No, I do not challenge.
MELISSA: 66 points. Ha ha.
JERRY: I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
MELISSA: You want some more ice tea?
JERRY: Sure.
MELISSA: (coughing loudly, while Jerry's expression turns to disgust) Wrong pipe.
[Monk's]
GEORGE: So she coughed.
JERRY: Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
GEORGE: Everything goes with naked.
JERRY: When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
GEORGE: Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
JERRY: But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
GEORGE: All right. It's grovel time.
HANKE: Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going through the Twelve Steps.
GEORGE: What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
HANKE: Yeah. Making amends.
GEORGE: Important step. Maybe the most important.
HANKE: Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.
JERRY: Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
HANKE: (eyeing George, who's looking expectedly up at him) Great. Great. Well, I'll see you guys later.
[Jerry's apartment]
KRAMER: (enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
JERRY: (pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
KRAMER: (noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
JERRY: Oh, come on!
KRAMER: No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
JERRY: You promise you'll never come in here again?
KRAMER: (chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
JERRY: (standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
KRAMER: Well, that's how cats do it.
JERRY: But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
KRAMER: OK. Let's turn the water on now.
JERRY: No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
GEORGE: (entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
JERRY: That's Step Ten?
GEORGE: All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
KRAMER: Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
JERRY: You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
KRAMER: Well, this has all been one big tease!
[Peterman Meeting]
ELAINE: (moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
PEGGY: (having seen Elaine touch her nearly full water bottle) I'm... gonna get another bottle of water.
WALTER: (taking a final swig from his own water bottle) Here, take mine. There's a little left.
PEGGY: (gulping down Walter's water) Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!
[Monk's]
HANKE: (talking with two men in Monk's) Guys, there's no doubt that the pay is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream.
MAN #1: You get pretty buff forearms.
HANKE: I don't know if I'm into that.
GEORGE: (entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
HANKE: George.
GEORGE: You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
HANKE: Apology? For what?
GEORGE: A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
HANKE: George, come on, not that neck hole thing.
GEORGE: Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
HANKE: No way, you would've completely stretched it out.
GEORGE: You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
HANKE: All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater.
[YMCA]
KRAMER: (taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
MAN IN SHOWER: (seeing Kramer staring at the showering man) Hey!
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
KRAMER: (walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
JERRY: What happened to you?
KRAMER: Ah, people in this city are crazy.
JERRY: (giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
KRAMER: (applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Yeah, a different one.
JERRY: (closing the door on him) Oh!
KRAMER: Jerry!
[Jerry's Apartment]
MELISSA: (wheeling out Jerry's bicycle) OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike.
JERRY: Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
MELISSA: (crouching down next to the bike) I should really clean those bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk.
JERRY: Please don't crouch.
MELISSA: Ouch! Caught my skin.
JERRY: Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
MELISSA: You got anything to snack on?
JERRY: Uhh...
MELISSA: (grabbing the pickle jar and straining to open it) Oh, pickles! Unnhhhh! It's a tough one.
JERRY: Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
MELISSA: (finally opening the jar) Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt. Look at that.
JERRY: (leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
[Peggy's Office]
ELAINE: Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
PEGGY: You seem to be with a lot of men.
ELAINE: What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
PEGGY: It's not. Good day.
ELAINE: (leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
[Jerry's Apartment]
JERRY: Well, technically he did apologize.
GEORGE: Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
JERRY: So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
GEORGE: That's right. I'm two in the hole!
JERRY: Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
GEORGE: Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
JERRY: Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
GEORGE: Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: (going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
JERRY: (answering the ringing phone) Hello?
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!
JERRY: World War I plane?
KRAMER: No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
JERRY: When are ya gettin' out?
KRAMER: I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.
[Peterman Meeting]
PETERMAN: Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick.
ELAINE: Oh, please.
PETERMAN: She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
PETERMAN: I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed.
ELAINE: Yeah, let me tell you something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
[Monk's]
GEORGE: So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
SPONSOR: Sponsor.
GEORGE: Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
SPONSOR: He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten.
GEORGE: Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
SPONSOR: Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?
GEORGE: I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
SPONSOR: I'm not sure what you want me to do.
GEORGE: Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
SPONSOR: You're quite upset, George.
GEORGE: Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
SPONSOR: Admit there's a higher power?
GEORGE: Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
Sponer: You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?
GEORGE: All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
[Kramer's Shower]
KRAMER: (on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
[Jerry's]
MELISSA: (naked on the couch) What are you doing?
JERRY: (naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
MELISSA: No, not that. Why are you naked?
JERRY: I thought naked is good.
MELISSA: (eyeing him) This isn't good naked.
[Rage-aholics Meeting]
SPONSER: George, here, have a seat.
GEORGE: (sitting down) Where's Hanke?
SPONSER: (motioning to the leader) Shhhhh.
LEADER: OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous.
GEORGE: What? Rate-aholics?
SPONSER: George, this can help you.
GEORGE: Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
LEADER: Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings.
GEORGE: Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
LEADER: Please don't call me 'Pinhead'.
GEORGE: I'm losin' it!
[Monk's]
JERRY: He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
GEORGE: Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
JERRY: You've got a little rage.
GEORGE: I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
JERRY: By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
GEORGE: This bread has nuts in it!
JERRY: (seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
ELAINE: Chicken wing shoulder blades.
JERRY: That's it?
ELAINE: No, but that's one problem. Why?
JERRY: Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
ELAINE: Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
GEORGE: Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
ELAINE: Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
JERRY: So you don't think it's attractive?
ELAINE: It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
GEORGE: Well, some women like it.
ELAINE: Hmm. Sickies.
[Kramer in the Shower]
KRAMER: (in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
PUDDY: (staring into space, picks up the phone) Puddy.
KRAMER: Is, uh, David Puddy there?
PUDDY: This is Puddy.
KRAMER: Well, this is Kramer.
PUDDY: I know.
KRAMER: Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
PUDDY: Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the auxiliary drainage line.
KRAMER: No. It says 'main line'.
PUDDY: It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?
KRAMER: Yeah.
PUDDY: (seeing Elaine come in) Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you through it.
KRAMER: Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.
[Elaine's Apartment]
ELAINE: Hey, Puddy.
PUDDY: Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him.
ELAINE: Balloon bouquet? For who?
PUDDY: Peggy took a turn for the worst.
ELAINE: Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
PUDDY: That's what he said.
ELAINE: I don't believe this woman.
PUDDY: Talk to me, Babe.
ELAINE: She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
PUDDY: Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about.
ELAINE: Huh?
PUDDY: (showing her his necklace) I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years.
ELAINE: What is this symbol?
PUDDY: It's a germ.
[Peggy's]
PEGGY: Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem with germs.
PUDDY: Don't you? Elaine.
(Elaine slowly creeps up towards Peggy)
PEGGY: (flinching away) Please!
PUDDY: I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex.
PEGGY: Really?
PUDDY: I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers she slogs around in.
ELAINE: Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
PUDDY: They're bacteria traps.
PEGGY: So you... just learned to live with it?
PUDDY: For the most part.
ELAINE: OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
[Jerry's Apartment]
JERRY: So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
MELISSA: This is nice.
JERRY: Yes, clothes. This is normal.
MELISSA: Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go down...
(as Melissa continues to talk, Jerry starts imagining her gorgeously naked, and stops paying attention)
MELISSA: Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?
JERRY: Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
MELISSA: I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow.
JERRY: Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
(as Jerry continues to talk, Melissa starts imagining him disgustingly, 'neanderthalishly' naked, and stops paying attention)
[Kramer on the Phone with Jerry]
KRAMER: (in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
JERRY: We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
KRAMER: Hang on.
(Kramer uses his shower garbage disposal to unclog the tub)
JERRY: So what are you up to?
KRAMER: Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
JERRY: Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
KRAMER: No problem there.
[Baskin Robbins]
HANKE: George. Thanks for coming down to talk to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very flexible. I just started yesterday.
GEORGE: Well, I'm here. What is it?
HANKE: Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve much better.
GEORGE: (ready to leave) Well, thank you.
HANKE: You're welcome.
KID: (entering the store) Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?
HANKE: Waffle or sugar cone?
GEORGE: Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
HANKE: What?
KID: Can you get on that cone?
HANKE: Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking about?
GEORGE: Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
KID: Is there anybody else here but you?
HANKE: I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I was wrong, so what more do you want from me?
GEORGE: I would like an apology.
HANKE: All right, look, you know--
KID #2: (entering the store) Did you try it?
KID: No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
HANKE: Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry.
GEORGE: Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
HANKE: I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!
[Restaurant]
ELAINE: (eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY: And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
KRAMER: Well, thank you.
ELAINE: Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
(all four make toast)
KRAMER: Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
(all four make another toast)
PEGGY: You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
ELAINE: This food was in the shower with you?
KRAMER: Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
(Peggy, Elaine, and Puddy all gag and wretch)
PUDDY: Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!
[Germ-o-Phobe Meeting]
GEORGE: Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
PUDDY: (waiting with Elaine and Peggy) No, germ-o-phobes.
GEORGE: Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
ELAINE: Kramer.
GEORGE: Right.
[Rage-a-olic Meeting]
HANKE: (speaking in front of other Rage-aholics) Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a rage-aholic.
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jason.
HANKE: Uh, this is my first meeting.
GEORGE: Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
HANKE: Please. Step Nine.
GEORGE: That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
(audience laughs)
GEORGE: It wasn't funny.
HANKE: It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck.
GEORGE: He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
[Setting: Tim Whatley's apartment]
ELAINE: So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
JERRY: Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
(Elaine laughs, Whatley enters)
TIM: Hey! Happy Chanukah!
JERRY: Hey, Tim. Great party.
(Tim holds up a mistletoe)
TIM: (Suggesting a kiss to Elaine) eh?
ELAINE: (Shrugging it off) eh.
TIM: (Accepting) Oh. (Turns to George) Hey, George, thanks again for getting me those Yankee tickets.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
TIM: (Notices a woman walking by) Oh, hey, listen, I'd better circulate.. (moving over to the woman) Happy Chanukah, Tiffany! (they both move off camera)
ELAINE: This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
GEORGE: I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
ELAINE: Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
JERRY: You have a standard fake?
ELAINE: Mm-hmm.
JERRY: (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
ELAINE: (Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
DENIM VEST: Hi!
(Scene cuts to Jerry talking to the woman)
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry.
WOMAN: Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.
(Scene cuts to Elaine)
ELAINE: Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
DENIM VEST: They're snaps. Listen, maybe we should, uh, go out some time?
ELAINE: Why don't I give you my phone number?
[Setting: Coffee Shop]
(George enters)
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
GEORGE: Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
JERRY: Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
GEORGE: Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: "We don't care, and it shows."
JERRY: (Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
GEORGE: Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
JERRY: See? You give, and you get.
GEORGE: (Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
JERRY: Oh, that's nice.
GEORGE: I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
JERRY: To a children's charity!
GEORGE: Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey!
JERRY: Hey.
(Waitress moves tward the table)
ELAINE: (To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
JERRY: "Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?
ELAINE: I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
JERRY: What does that mean?
ELAINE: (Embarrassed) Free sub.
(George lets out a depressed sigh while reading a card)
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
ELAINE: What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
GEORGE: It's nothing, stop it..
JERRY: When George was growing up..
GEORGE: (Interrupting) Jerry, No!
JERRY: His father..
GEORGE: No!
JERRY: Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
ELAINE: Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
GEORGE: (pleading) Alright..
JERRY: And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
(Elaine starts laughing uncontrollably - and continues to do so)
GEORGE: Jerry! Stop it!
JERRY: And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
(Jerry joins in with Elaine's laughter)
GEORGE: I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Elaine is digging into her purse)
ELAINE: Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
JERRY: So?
ELAINE: I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
JERRY: No, you walk out.
ELAINE: Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
JERRY: No, you wait for the movie!
ELAINE: (Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
JERRY: You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
KRAMER: (Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
JERRY: So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
ELAINE: That's a good idea.
(Kramer's cordless phone rings, startling him. He digs through his coat, and pulls it out of the pocket)
KRAMER: (Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
JERRY: What strike?
KRAMER: Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
JERRY: You?
ELAINE: Worked?
JERRY: Bagels?
KRAMER: Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
ELAINE: Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
ELAINE: What were your.. demands?
KRAMER: Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
ELAINE: I believe that's the new minimum wage.
KRAMER: Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
JERRY: Why didn't you ever mention this?
KRAMER: Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]
(Kramer walks through the door)
KRAMER: All right, everybody! I'm back!
MANAGER: Who are you?
KRAMER: Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
MANAGER: Oh yeah! Kramer.
KRAMER: Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
MANAGER: NO, I"m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.
KRAMER: Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
MANAGER: I could use someone for the holidays..
KRAMER: Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
MANAGER: Those are rasin bagels.
KRAMER: (Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
[Setting: Horse Track Betting]
(Elaine confronts two unattractive bookies)
ELAINE: So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
BOOKIE: So. You're Elaine Benes. We've been getting calls fro you for 5 years.
ELAINE: So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
BOOKIE: (Interrupting) Hey, Charlie! Guess who's here. Elaine Benes.
(Co-Worker in the back speaks up)
CHARLIE: Elaine Benes?!
(Various other men in the line behind Elaine say the same thing)
BOOKIE: You make a lot of man friends. You know who's a man? Charlie here, he's a man. You know who else? Me. I'm a man.
CHARLIE: (faintly) I'm a man.
ELAINE: Ohh.. my..
BOOKIE: I'll have this best guy call your real number. You just, uh, give it to me. And that way, I'll have it. (Slides a pad over to Elaine so she can write it down)
ELAINE: My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
[Setting: classy restaurant]
(Jerry and Tim Whatley meet)
TIM: Hey, Jerry.
JERRY: Hey, Tim.
TIM: What's up?
JERRY: Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
TIM: Mazel Tov.
(Jerry's date, Gwen, arrives. She's completely unattractive)
GWEN: Jerry.. hi.
JERRY: Gwen?
GWEN: Yeah.
JERRY: (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
GWEN: Yeah! Come on, our table is ready.
(Tim gives Jerry a face - almost like he feels sorry for Jerry)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
JERRY: Have you come across this?
GEORGE: Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
JERRY: (Relating) Like the Batman villain?
GEORGE: (Annoyed) If that helps you..
JERRY: So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.
GEORGE: (Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
JERRY: (Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
GEORGE: (With pride) Made it up.
JERRY: (Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
GEORGE: What do you think?
JERRY: It has a certain understated stupidity.
GEORGE: (Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
JERRY: ..Yeah.
(Enter Kramer)
(He is holding a sack full of bagels)
KRAMER: Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!
JERRY: How was your first day?
KRAMER: Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
(Jerry and George stop before they take a bite from their bagels)
JERRY: Your hands were in the dough?
KRAMER: No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
(George spits his bagel out)
GEORGE: Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
JERRY: Happy Festivus!
KRAMER: What's Festivus?
JERRY: When George was growing up..
GEORGE: (Interrupting) No!
JERRY: His father..
GEORGE: Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
(Elaine enters while George is exiting)
ELAINE: Happy Festivus, Georgie.
(George leaves yelling out "God!")
KRAMER: Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
ELAINE: Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
JERRY: You're still trying to gget that free sub?
ELAINE: Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
JERRY: Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
ELAINE: Maybe.
[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]
FRANK: Kramer, I got your message. I haven't celebrated Festivus in years! What is your interest?
KRAMER: Well, just tell me everything, huh?
FRANK: Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had - but so did another man. As I rained blows opon him, I realized there had to be another way!
KRAMER: What happened to the doll?
FRANK: It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. "A Festivus for the rest of us!"
KRAMER: That musta been some kind of doll.
FRANK: She was.
[Setting: Kruger Office Building]
(George is in the hallway, dispensing his made-up gifts)
GEORGE: Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
SANDY: (After reading the cheap gift, she's suddenly unimpressed) ..Oh.. thanks. (Walks off)
(George passes an open doorway)
GEORGE: Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
PHIL: Ow!
(George meets up with Kruger)
GEORGE: Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
KRUGER: Not if you could see our books.. what's this?
GEORGE: The Human Fund.
KRUGER: Whatever. (Walks off)
GEORGE: Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!
[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]
(Frank is still telling Kramer about Festivus)
FRANK: And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year.
KRAMER: Is there a tree?
FRANK: No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting.
KRAMER: Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
FRANK: Let's do it then! Festivus is back! I'll get the pole out of the crawl space. (Turns to leave, meets up with Elaine)
ELAINE: Hello, Frank.
FRANK: Hello, woman. (leaves)
ELAINE: Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
KRAMER: No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
MANAGER: Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.
KRAMER: But it's Festivus.
MANAGER: What?
KRAMER: You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
MANAGER: That's not a right.
KRAMER: Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
ELAINE: No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
KRAMER: What? You're siding with management?!
ELAINE: No, I just..
KRAMER: (Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!
[Setting: Taxi Cab]
(Gwen joins Jerry in the cab. She's in her attractive state)
GWEN: Hey.
JERRY: Boy, am I glad to see you.
GWEN: You were expecting someone else?
JERRY: You never know.
GWEN: (To driver) You know, you might want to take the tunnel.
JERRY: So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
(All the sudden, Gwen is extremely ugly)
GWEN: I can go either way.
JERRY: (Shocked) You're telling me.
[Setting: the Coffee Shop]
GEORGE: So, she was switching? Back and forth?
JERRY: Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
GEORGE: So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
JERRY: I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
GEORGE: Lights out.
JERRY: Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
GEORGE: (Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
JERRY: That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
GEORGE: I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
JERRY: Oh, that's classy.
(Frank and Kramer enter. Frank is dragging an aluminum pole)
KRAMER: Well, Happy Festivus.
GEORGE: What is that? Is taht the pole?!
FRANK: George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.
GEORGE: (Sulking) That's why I hate it.
KRAMER: There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
FRANK: George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating Festivus is heard)
FRANK: Read that poem.
GEORGE: (Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
FRANK: You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!
ESTELLE: Leave him alone!
FRANK: Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
(George has a break down)
GEORGE: No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
FRANK: We had some good times.
(Gwen walks in, and greets Jerry. She's in her unattractive state)
GWEN: Hey.
JERRY: I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
GWEN: Hi.
KRAMER: (Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.
GWEN: So, you ready to go?
JERRY: Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]
(Kramer is picketing out side.)
KRAMER: Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
(Cut to inside the store)
MANAGER: (To a waiting Elaine) Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.
ELAINE: (Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
KRAMER: (From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
ELAINE: What did you do?
KRAMER: You've been warned.
(Elaine looks out the window, and sees Kramer at the pay phone)
ELAINE: Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
(Steam starts coming from a pipe on the machine. Elaine hangs up)
WORKER: Hey, the steam valve's broke.
MANAGER: Can we still make bagels?
WORKER: Sure. It's just a little steamy.
(Kramer knocks on the shop door)
KRAMER: Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
(No one inside seems to care. Kramer waits by the door to see if anyone was affected)
[Setting: Kruger Building]
KRUGER: George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? (Hands the check to George)
GEORGE: 20 thousand dollars?
KRUGER: Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
[Setting: Coffee Shop]
GWEN: Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?
JERRY: Why? It's our place.
GWEN: I just found a rubber band in my soup.
JERRY: Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
(Enter George)
GEORGE: Hey! Surprise, surprise!
JERRY: Hey, Georgie!
GWEN: I think I'm just gonna go.
JERRY: I'll be here.
(Gwen leaves)
GEORGE: (Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.
JERRY: She didn't touch it.
(George spoons through his soup, and finds a rubber band)
GEORGE: Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
JERRY: 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
GEORGE: I don't know.
JERRY: Excuse me?
GEORGE: I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
JERRY: You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
GEORGE: I'm serious.
JERRY: You're going to start your own charity?
GEORGE: I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
[Setting: Outside H&H Bagels]
(Kramer is chanting 'no bagels, no bagels..' Elaine walks out, her make-up is distorted, and her face is pale because of the steam)
ELAINE: Kramer, the vest just called.
KRAMER: (Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
ELAINE: Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
KRAMER: And?
ELAINE: (Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Gwen walks by, she's in her ugly state)
GWEN: Kramer, Hi!
KRAMER: Oh, hello.
GWEN: It's Gwen.. We met .. at the coffee shop.
KRAMER: Ah-huh.
GWEN: I'm dating your friend, Jerry..
KRAMER: Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
GWEN: That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.
KRAMER: Oh, he's a tomcat.
(Cut to Elaine)
(She meets up with Denim Vest on the street corner)
ELAINE: Steve.
DENIM VEST: Hmm?
ELAINE: It's Elaine.
DENIM VEST: From Tim Whatley's party?
ELAINE: Yeah.
DENIM VEST: You look.. different.
ELAINE: I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
DENIM VEST: Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.
ELAINE: No, no, no. You give me your number.
DENIM VEST: Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad, and starts writing a number down) Do you have the mumps?
ELAINE: No.
DENIM VEST: Typhoid?
ELAINE: No.
DENIM VEST: (Hands her the paper, and runs off) Yama - Hama!
(Elaine looks at the number, and sees it's the same as the number on a nearby truck)
ELAINE: A fake number! Blimey!
[Setting: Kruger's office]
KRUGER: George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.
GEORGE: Well, there could be.
KRUGER: But there isn't.
GEORGE: Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
KRUGER: George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake Christmas gift.
GEORGE: Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
KRUGER: Vemonous?
GEORGE: Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
KRUGER: Are you making all this up, too?
GEORGE: Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
KRUGER: Yeah, you probably should.
[Setting: The Costanza's house]
GEORGE: Happy Festivus!
FRANK: George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?
GEORGE: Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
FRANK: Have you seen the pole, Kruger?
GEORGE: Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
FRANK: He's gonna see it.
(Enter Jerry and Elaine. Elaine is still ugly from the steam)
GEORGE: Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!
ELAINE: I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
GEORGE: Embracing my roots.
JERRY: They nailed you on the 20 G's?
GEORGE: Busted cold.
(Cut to Kruger and Frank)
(They're looking at the Festivus pole)
FRANK: It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.
KRUGER: I find your belief system fascinating.
(Enter Kramer)
(Kramer's with the two bookies from Horse Track Betting)
KRAMER: Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
BOOKIE: Hello again, Miss Benes.
ELAINE: What are you doing here?
BOOKIE: Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..
KRAMER: (Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
(Estelle comes through the kitchen door, hitting Kramer as she opens it)
ESTELLE: Dinner's ready!
FRANK: Let's begin.
(Everyone sits around the table. Kruger recognized Kramer from "The Meat Slicer" episode..) KRUGER: Dr.. Van Nostrand?
KRAMER: Uh.. that's right.
(Cut to Frank)
FRANK: Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!
GEORGE: Oh, God.
FRANK: (To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
(Frank sits down, Jerry gives a face that says "That's a shame". Gwen walks in)
GWEN: Jerry!
JERRY: Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
GWEN: Kramer told me.
KRAMER: Another Festivus miracle!
(Jerry gives Kramer a death stare. He shuts up. Gwen notices Elaine)
GWEN: I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.
ELAINE: Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
(Gwen leaves, Jerry follows)
JERRY: Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
ELAINE: (To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?
BOOKIE: He had to be shot.
FRANK: And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.
GEORGE: Not the feats of strength..
FRANK: This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.
KRAMER: Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
JERRY: I thought you were on strike?
KRAMER: Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
GEORGE: Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
(Exit Kramer)
KRUGER: (Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?
FRANK: Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!
GEORGE: Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
FRANK: (Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!
(Cuts to an outside view of the Costanza's house)
ESTELLE: I think you can take him, Georgie!
GEORGE: Oh, come on! Be sensible.
FRANK: Stop crying, and fight your father!
GEORGE: Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
FRANK: This is the best Festivus ever!
[Setting: H&H Bagel Shop]
(Kramer is shaping some dough and chewing gum - his gum falls into the dough. He starts looking for the gum, and starts extracting it from the dough. The manger is watching)
MANAGER: Alright. That's enough. You're fired.
KRAMER: Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
[Setting: A car dealership]
(Jerry and George are looking over some cars)
GEORGE: When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
JERRY: Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
GEORGE: Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
JERRY: I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
GEORGE: No. That's just electric.
JERRY: What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
GEORGE: (Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
JERRY: Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
GEORGE: The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
JERRY: Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
GEORGE: And the underwater bubble cities?
JERRY: It's like we're living in the '50s here.
(Kramer is bouncing up and down on the rear bumper of one of the cars for sale)
KRAMER: It's good suspension!
JERRY: (To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
GEORGE: Shhh… What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
JERRY: (Gestures to his forehead) You're getting that vein again.
GEORGE: I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
JERRY: (Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
GEORGE: Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
JERRY: I guess he graduated.
GEORGE: There's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
(Kramer, in one of the cars, honks the horn)
JERRY: (To Kramer) Thank you.
GEORGE: Puddy's just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) You'll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, you're on your back like a turtle.
JERRY: All right. Calm down.
GEORGE: My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin' at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let's stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
(Kramer is now on his back, under a car)
KRAMER: Jerry, I don't think this thing is hooked up right.
(Jerry and George go to enter the office buildings)
JERRY: (To Kramer) All right, we're goin' in.
(A salesman walks up to Kramer. He's still under the car)
SALESMAN: You've got a good eye, there. I see you've noticed the uni-body construction. I'm Rick. Are you looking to buy or to lease?
(Kramer emerges from under the car)
KRAMER: Uh, borrow. It's for my friend. Yeah, he'll be buying..
RICK: Maybe I should talk to him.
KRAMER: Oh, I don't think so. No, he's an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That's where I come in.
RICK: I see. So, you're his manag-
(Kramer hops into the car)
KRAMER: Yeah, neighbor. That's right. Yeah, why don't we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
[Scene cuts to the insides of the dealership building. Jerry and George are waiting for a salesman to assist them]
GEORGE: Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "I'll walk out of here right now!"
(A salesman approaches)
SALESMAN: Can I help you with something?
GEORGE: (Threatening) Hold it! One more step and we're walkin'!
JERRY: (Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we're just waiting for David Puddy.
GEORGE: (Still with a tone) He is. You don't know what I'm doin' here.
(Elaine walks into the showroom with David Puddy)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
PUDDY: Sorry I'm late.
ELAINE: (Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
JERRY: Ah. Where'd you go?
ELAINE: (Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.
PUDDY: Arby's.
ELAINE: I had the roast beef…
JERRY: So, Puddy, I decided I'm gonna go with another 900 convertible.
PUDDY: All right. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.
ELAINE: (Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
PUDDY: Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.
ELAINE: Oh. (Leaves for the room)
PUDDY: (To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I'll show you the 900.
GEORGE: (Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
[Scene cuts to Kramer. He's in the car with the salesman, Rick, and they're driving an unknown street]
RICK: … And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock brakes, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please. (Goes back to the features) An adjustable steering wheel, and… Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..
KRAMER: No, no, no, I didn't.
RICK: Well, that's okay. (Pointing) We'll make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.
KRAMER: (Up to something) Well, it's a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I'm gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it'll handle my daily routine.
RICK: Well where are we going?
KRAMER: Just a little place I like to call, "You'll see".
[Setting: Puddy's office]
(George and Jerry are in conference with Puddy)
GEORGE: I'm starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
PUDDY: (Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
GEORGE: (Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
JERRY: (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
GEORGE: Don't think it can't happen! (Leaves)
JERRY: So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
PUDDY: I don't care for that term.
JERRY: Oh. Sorry, I didn't know..
PUDDY: No, I don't know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.
JERRY: I saw one once that could do sign language.
PUDDY: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.
JERRY: Yeah, Koko.
PUDDY: Right, Koko. That chimp's all right. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Returning, George sees Jerry reluctantly slap hands with Puddy)
GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey! What's goin' on here? (To Jerry) You didn't agree to anything, did ya?
JERRY: No. We both just saw the same monkey.
GEORGE: (Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
PUDDY: (Standing up) Well, there's a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)
GEORGE: (To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.
JERRY: (Getting a dollar out) Where's your money?
GEORGE: (Talking it) I'm here helpin' you.
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey. Where's Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
GEORGE: (On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. That's what they want you to think.
JERRY: Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
ELAINE: (Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: (Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?
JERRY: No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
ELAINE: (Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.
JERRY: Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they're doing sign language now.
ELAINE: It's that bad?
JERRY: What do you think the Nazis were doin'? (Imitates the Nazi's salute) That was the heil-five.
ELAINE: (Pointing out) Isn't that from your act, like, ten years ago?
JERRY: (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the '80's, and it's still relatable today.
(Puddy approaches them)
PUDDY: Good news. We got a 900 in black. That's the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Elaine and Jerry exchange looks)
ELAINE: Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
(Elaine takes Puddy's arm, leading him to the room)
PUDDY: (Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.
[Setting: Dealership back room]
(George is eyeing a Twix candy bar through the vending machine glass)
GEORGE: Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
(George put in his dollar, but the machine rejects it. He tries to jam it in, same result. He tries one more time - unsuccessful)
GEORGE: Ah, come on!
(A heavy-set mechanic approaches and stands in line behind George to use the vending machine. George steps back to let him use it. The machine readily accepts the mechanic's dollar)
GEORGE: Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
MECHANIC: (While retrieving his candy) No.
GEORGE: Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
MECHANIC: (While walking away) Don't have one.
GEORGE: (Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldn't help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
MECHANIC: (Calm) You're incorrect.
GEORGE: (Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? I'm very hungry.
MECHANIC: (While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier.
GEORGE: (Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You're all doin' a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
[Setting: Dealership car]
(Rick and Kramer are still on the test-drive. The back seat is filled with various items - those including a giant, stuffed Tweety bird)
RICK: Uh, Mr. Kramer, we're really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.
KRAMER: Now look, Rick. I'm very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Let's see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) It's the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez…
[Setting: Dealership back room]
(Jerry walks up to the vending machine. George is on his stomach, reaching under the vending machine for change)
JERRY: (Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
GEORGE: People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they're too lazy to pick it up.
JERRY: Either that, or they've got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don't you just go to the cashier?
(George gets up)
GEORGE: The cashier is at lunch - which is where I'd like to be.
JERRY: How much was under there?
GEORGE: (Looking at his finger) I think somethin' bit me. I just need another nickel.
JERRY: (While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
GEORGE: Ho, ho, ho! He's got a live one. He's just reeling his big fish in!
JERRY: Hey, can I have my dollar back?
GEORGE: (Stingy) It's wrinkled. It's worthless.
(Jerry gives George a look, then leaves. George hurriedly puts the money into the machine)
GEORGE: (As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
(A man holding a donut walks past George)
MAN: They just put out some more donuts.
GEORGE: They did?
MAN: (Holding his up) Last one.
[Setting: Dealership car]
(Kramer's still on the road with Rick)
KRAMER: Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
RICK: Actually, it looks like we're gonna need some gas.
KRAMER: Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
RICK: (Looking) Well, it's on "E".
KRAMER: You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I don't want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
RICK: (Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend's car for free.
KRAMER: (In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
[Setting: Dealership back room]
(George enters with a salesman, regarding the machine)
GEORGE: As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, it's gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guy's eatin' it!
SALESMAN: Well, how do you know that one's yours?
GEORGE: Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must've bought one, and gotten both.
SALESMAN: Sir, are you gonna buy a car?
GEORGE: No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the door's window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
[Scene cuts to Puddy in the copy room with Elaine. He's trying to fix the Xerox machine]
PUDDY: Paper jam.. Got it!
ELAINE: Yay!
PUDDY: (Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.
ELAINE: David, um, I..
PUDDY: (Still holding out his hand) Don't leave me hangin'.
ELAINE: You're a salesman now - and the high-five is… it's very "grease monkey."
PUDDY: What did I tell you about that?
ELAINE: Ah, I, I'm sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
PUDDY: (Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? I'll tell you what's stupid. You. Stupid.
ELAINE: (Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.
PUDDY: Yeah? So are you. You're the grease monkey.
ELAINE: (Confused at David's attempts at a comeback) Uh… that doesn't make any sense. I am leaving.
PUDDY: Yeah, if you leave, we're through.
ELAINE: Fine! We're through!
PUDDY: Oh, so you're leaving?
ELAINE: (While leaving) That's right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin' me to Arby's…
JERRY: (Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you…?
(She exits. Puddy sits down at his desk - disturbed)
PUDDY: Let's finish this up.
JERRY: Did you two break up?
PUDDY: (While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chick's whacked. We're history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things: uh, rust-proofing…
JERRY: "Rust-proofing"?
PUDDY: (Reading off what he's adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder's fee…
JERRY: "Finder's fee"? It was on the lot!
PUDDY: Yeah, that's right. (Continues reading off) Uh, floor mats, keys…
JERRY: "Keys"?!
PUDDY: How ya gonna start it?
[Setting: Dealership's shop]
(George catches up with the portly mechanic)
GEORGE: Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
MECHANIC: First of all, it wasn't a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar.
GEORGE: Huh. You must think I'm pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think he's stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
MECHANIC: It's uh, it's just a little nougat.
GEORGE: Nougat? Please. I think I've reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So let's not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
MECHANIC: (Pointing to George's forehead) You know, you're gettin' a little vein there..
GEORGE: (Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I can't believe this guy..
(Jerry rushes in with a box of candy)
JERRY: Hey, George!
GEORGE: Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)
JERRY: No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he's treatin' me just like a regular customer, now!
GEORGE: I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There's no laws in this place. Anything goes! It's Thunderdome!
(A saleswoman approaches them)
SALESWOMAN: Is someone helping you?
GEORGE: Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
[Setting: Dealership car]
RICK: (Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now?
KRAMER: There's still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
RICK: How low are you gonna go?
KRAMER: Oh, I've been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You'll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
RICK: Have you ever been completely below the slash?
KRAMER: Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I don't know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
RICK: (As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer, the road!
(Kramer swerves around, trying to get back in place)
KRAMER: Whoop! Whoop!
[Setting: Puddy's office]
(Jerry and George are in conference)
JERRY: (Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard… ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
GEORGE: All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
JERRY: George! Can we focus on the car, here?
GEORGE: I'm starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
PUDDY: (Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature here, and we'll get you that yellow car ready to go.
JERRY: Yellow? I wanted black.
PUDDY: I can't give you black at that price.
JERRY: (Pleading) George, would you help me, please?
GEORGE: (Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!
JERRY: Sing it, sister!
GEORGE: Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch…
JERRY: (Exasperated) Oh, God…
GEORGE: (Losing it) …does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or… Lem is not gonna get away with this!
(Jerry follows George out the office)
JERRY: (To Puddy) I'll be right back.
PUDDY: Okay.
(Jerry catches up with George)
JERRY: Hey, George!
[Setting: Dealership car]
(The needle is now below "E". Rick is looking at it)
RICK: Is it just the angle I'm looking from?
KRAMER: No, Sir. We are down there.
RICK: Oh, this is amazing! Oh, I've never felt so alive!
KRAMER: All right, I'm satisfied. We better get some gas.
RICK: What? Well, we can't stop now.
KRAMER: What do you mean?
RICK: We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.
KRAMER: There was no plan.
RICK: Well, let's make it the plan! Let's just… go for it! Like Thelma and Louise.
KRAMER: What, they drove to a dealership?
RICK: No, they drove off a cliff.
(Kramer eyes Rick, frightened)
KRAMER: You are one sick mama… I like it.
RICK: Mr. Kramer, the road!
(Kramer swerves around again)
KRAMER: Yup! Yup!
[Setting: Elaine's apartment]
(Phone rings, she answers it)
ELAINE: Hello?
JERRY: (Over the phone) Elaine, you've got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin' me on this car, which is yellow now!
ELAINE: (Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?
JERRY: (Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!
(Elaine flinches with every loud banging noise)
ELAINE: What?!
JERRY: You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
ELAINE: (Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
JERRY: You're gonna get back together, anyway. It's thousands of dollars!
ELAINE: Oh, I don't know..
JERRY: Come on. Then you don't have to see him again 'til my 15,000-mile check.
ELAINE: Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
JERRY: Fine.
ELAINE: And I didn't like that roast beef, so how 'bout some lunch?
JERRY: No. No lunch.
ELAINE: I'll hang this phone up right now!
JERRY: All right! Lunch!
ELAINE: I'll see ya. (Hanging up the phone)
JERRY: Bye. (Hangs up)
JERRY: (Frustrated, he reacts) Everybody's ripping me off!
[Scene cuts to George at the customer complaint window]
GEORGE: Yes, I'd like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
WILLIE: When did you bring the car in?
GEORGE: (To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right… I'm gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don't I just flush my money down the toilet?
WILLIE: Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?
GEORGE: One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
WILLIE: Are you saying he grabbed your candy bar away from you?
GEORGE: He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
WILLIE: I thought you said it was a Twix.
GEORGE: Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
WILLIE: Maybe it was.
GEORGE: Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
WILLIE: What about the Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar?
GEORGE: No. Rice and caramel.
WILLIE: Nougat?
GEORGE: No.
WILLIE: Positive?
GEORGE: Please.
(A woman appears from behind the window)
WOMAN: You know they changed the name from Hundred-Thousand-Dollar bar to Hundred-Grand?
GEORGE: All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
(An old man sitting in a nearby chair speaks up. He's Willie's father)
WILLIE SR: I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.
(The man behind George speaks up)
MAN: What's the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?
GEORGE: They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
WILLIE SR: Not Skittles.
WILLIE: Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don't talk.
WOMAN: (Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?
WILLIE: He likes it!
GEORGE: All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
MAN: (In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.
GEORGE: No! There's no coconut!
WOMAN: (Behind service window) I'm allergic to coconut.
WILLIE: I'm not.
WILLIE SR: …A nickel!
[Setting: Dealership office showroom]
(Elaine enters, and hands Jerry the receipt for her cab)
ELAINE: Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
PUDDY: I'm with a customer.
(Elaine throws up her hands, giving a face of disgust, and starts to walk away)
ELAINE: Uh…
JERRY: No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. What's important is you two getting back together. Eh, then we'll talk about the car.
PUDDY: (Like a kid) I don't want to get back with her. She's too bossy.
ELAINE: (Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
JERRY: Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don't we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
ELAINE AND PUDDY: Right.
JERRY: Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
ELAINE: I guess.
PUDDY: Good point.
JERRY: (Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
[Setting: Gas station]
(Kramer pulls the car into a gas station and gets out)
KRAMER: Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? I'll get us a couple of Twix bars.
RICK: No, no coconut for me.
KRAMER: All right, I'll get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
(Rick sits back in the car a second, then hurriedly jumps out and reaches for the gas pump. Kramer pops up from behind the pump and scares him)
RICK: Ahh!
KRAMER: No, man! Not the gas!
RICK: But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!
KRAMER: Do you think that this'll make you happy? 'Cause it won't!
RICK: (Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me.
(Kramer grabs him by the collar)
KRAMER: Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
(The car makes puttering noises)
RICK: Maybe we better get moving.
KRAMER: It's good to have you back, Stan.
(Both hop into the car)
RICK: It's Rick, by the way.
KRAMER: No time!
[Setting: Dealership's customer service room]
WILLIE: Mr. Costanza, I really don't have time for this.
GEORGE: Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldn't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
WILLIE: "Candy line-up"?
GEORGE: I've spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
WILLIE: It took you an hour?
GEORGE: Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you… the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
SALESWOMAN: Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy!
GEORGE: That's my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! They're - they're all on the floor!
(George starts picking up the numbered cards from off the floor. He sees the mechanic eating one of the candy bars)
GEORGE: And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
MECHANIC: No.
MAN: Hey, this Clark bar is good.
GEORGE: It's a Twix! They're all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And you've robbed it! You've all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
MECHANIC: They're all gone.
GEORGE: (Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
[Scene cuts to Elaine, Puddy and Jerry, all in conference]
ELAINE: What was that?
PUDDY: There's a mental hospital right near here.
JERRY: All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arby's no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesn't read a book.
ELAINE: (While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, that's not bad.
PUDDY: I can live with that.
JERRY: So, you're back together?
PUDDY: Yeah.
(Jerry sees them stare at each other, smiling)
JERRY: All right, all right. All right, that's enough! Let's get back to my deal. That undercoating, that's a rip-off, isn't it, David?
PUDDY: Oh, we don't even know what it is.
JERRY: So, I'm gettin' the insider's deal?
PUDDY: Insider's deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Jerry gives a face of resentment)
[Setting: Dealership car]
(Rick and Kramer are driving back to the dealership)
RICK: (Seeing the turn-off up ahead) There's the dealer!
KRAMER: Hey!
RICK: We did! We pulled it off! I can't believe it! Where's the needle?
KRAMER: Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
RICK: Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.
KRAMER: Well, that's a weird thing to say…
RICK: I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. I wonder… hmm.
(They both eye each other, then lock hands. Kramer slams on the gas, and they both cheer and scream as they drive on)
[Setting: NYC Cab]
(Elaine, George, and Jerry are riding home in a cab)
ELAINE: This is nice. What kind of car is this?
CABBIE: Caprice Classic.
ELAINE: (To Jerry) You couldn't just give him one high-five?
JERRY: And where does it end? Then everyone's doin' it. It's like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Don't go there." - Someone's gotta take a stand!
GEORGE: (Munching on a hamburger) This Arby's is good.
ELAINE: So, George, I still don't understand - how was that a setup?
JERRY: And who were you tryin' to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
GEORGE: I don't know. All of 'em. They're all crooks! Besides, I couldn't get all different candy bars, anyway.
(Kramer and Rick speed by the cab in the Saab - both screaming and yelling)
GEORGE: What was that?
JERRY: I think there's a mental hospital near here.
ELAINE: Very near.
[Scene cuts to Kramer and Rick. Still yelling, they slowly come to a stop]
KRAMER: Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
RICK: You - you can probably let go of my hand now.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, I'll think about it..
RICK: Do you have my card?
(After the Castle Rock Logo Willie Sr. voice is heard saying "A Nickel")
[Waitress giving Elaine her meal at Monk's.]
WAITRESS: Careful, this plate is extremely hot.
(Elaine touching the plate.)
ELAINE: Thank you. Ow!
WAITRESS: I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
ELAINE: I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
(Puddy entering Monk's in a fur coat)
PUDDY: Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
(Elaine cracking up when she sees Puddy's coat.)
ELAINE: I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
PUDDY: It's my winter coat.
ELAINE: A fur?
(Puddy sits down in the booth.)
PUDDY: Is there a problem?
ELAINE: A seemingly infinite supply.
(Elaine touching the plate again.)
ELAINE: Ow! Careful, it's hot.
(Puddy touching the plate.)
PUDDY: Ow!
[Jerry, in his apartment with Elaine and George.]
JERRY: So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
ELAINE: He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
JERRY: And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
ELAINE: Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
GEORGE: And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
ELAINE: We never dated in winter.
JERRY: You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
ELAINE: Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
GEORGE: An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
JERRY: Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
GEORGE: All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
JERRY: Cheapness is not a sense.
ELAINE: I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
JERRY: I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
(Kramer enters Jerry's apartment with Newman.)
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: You got any pliers?
JERRY: What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
NEWMAN: Hilarious.
KRAMER: Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
ELAINE: Why?
NEWMAN: To prevent an ambush.
KRAMER: Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
JERRY: But then anyone can just look in and see you.
KRAMER: Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
ELAINE: I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
(Jerry pulls a stub of paper out of his wallet.)
JERRY: Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
KRAMER: Mmm... Nice wallet.
NEWMAN: Wallet.
JERRY: What?
(Kramer showing Jerry the contents of his pocket)
KRAMER: Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
JERRY: That's a five.
(Kramer singing as he switches his peephole around)
KRAMER: I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...
(Silvio coming up behind Kramer)
SILVIO: Eh, what are you doing?
KRAMER: Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.
SILVIO: Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?
KRAMER: Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
SILVIO: Like what?
KRAMER: Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
SILVIO: No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.
KRAMER: Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
SILVIO: Newman? He did this, too?
KRAMER: Well, yeah.
SILVIO: I deal with him.
(George showing Jerry a newspaper ad.)
GEORGE: Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
JERRY: Except the store's in Delaware.
GEORGE: I'll have 'em overnight it.
JERRY: Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
GEORGE: It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
JERRY: Why?
(George pulling out his wallet.)
GEORGE: Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
(Jerry holding up a hamburger while holding George's wallet.)
JERRY: But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
GEORGE: I need everything in there.
(Jerry looking through George's wallet )
JERRY: Irish money?
GEORGE: I might go there.
JERRY: Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
(George grabbing back his wallet.)
GEORGE: All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
(Newman walks up to Kramer's door, looks into his reverse peephole, and sees Kramer, wearing an open shirt, scratching his stomach with a backscratcher, with opera music playing in the background. Newman knocks on the door, and Kramer startingly peers into his reverse peephole)
KRAMER: Who is it?
NEWMAN: It's Newman.
KRAMER: What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
NEWMAN: I can't believe I'm being evicted.
KRAMER: What? What are you talking about?
NEWMAN: The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.
KRAMER: No. No, he can't do that.
NEWMAN: I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.
KRAMER: Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
(Kramer closes his door behind him to go with Newman, when Newman sees that he's still wearing his open shirt)
NEWMAN: Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
[Jerry, at Joe Mayo's party with George.]
JERRY: George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
GEORGE: A man carries a wallet.
JERRY: You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
(Joe Mayo, coming up to George and Jerry.)
JOY MAYO: Hey, Jerry.
JERRY: Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
JOY MAYO: Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?
(George tossing his coat on a chair.)
GEORGE: Love to.
JOY MAYO: Thanks. Jerry...
JERRY: Music?
JOY MAYO: Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?
JERRY: But I could do that and the music.
JOY MAYO: Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!
JERRY: I was ready to get jiggy with it.
(Elaine entering the party with Puddy who's wearing his fur coat.)
PUDDY: Hey.
JERRY: Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE: Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
(Jerry showcasing his no-wallet look.)
JERRY: So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
(Elaine eyeing Jerry patheticall, then turning to George.)
ELAINE: So, George... did you get the chair?
GEORGE: No, I don't have it yet.
JERRY: So, we're givin' him nothing?
(George pulling out a picture of the chair.)
GEORGE: No, I brought a picture of the chair.
JERRY: Did you at least get him a card?
GEORGE: I thought we'd all sign the picture.
(Joe Mayo walking up to the gang with an armload of guests' coats.)
JOY MAYO: Elaine...
ELAINE: Hey, Joe Mayo.
JOY MAYO: I need you to be in charge of coats.
(Elaine being given all the coats and Puddy's fur coat thrown on top.)
ELAINE: Oh, fantastic.
JOY MAYO: And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?
PUDDY: Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
(Jerry over by the aquarium talking to a girl.)
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
KERI: Nice.
JERRY: (talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
GEORGE: (answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
PUDDY: (standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
(Putting the coats on a bed, Elaine sees the window, opens it, and throws Puddy's coat out)
ELAINE: Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
[Silvio with his wife, Kramer, and Newman in Jerry's apartment.]
SILVIO: Why are we in Jerry's apartment?
KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
SILVIO: Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.
KRAMER: Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
SILVIO: I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
KRAMER: Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
SILVIO: OK, on your word he can stay.
KRAMER: All right.
SILVIO: But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
KRAMER: Well, you won't regret it.
(Kramer looks up at Newman and he sees him close to kissing Silvio's wife. Silvio, sees the cigar fall right out of Kramer's mouth.
SILVIO: What's wrong?
(Kramer hurriedly picks the cigar up, but puts the wrong end in his mouth, burning his tongue, and quickly replacing it the right way in his mouth)
JOY MAYO: Elaine, thanks for coming.
ELAINE: Good working with you.
(Puddy coming up to them in his fur coat ready to go.)
PUDDY: All right, let's hit the bricks.
(Elaine sees Puddy still having a coat.)
ELAINE: What?
JOY MAYO: Hey, I got a coat just like this!
ELAINE: Oh. Uhhh...
[Elaine at Monk's with George and Jerry.]
ELAINE: So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
GEORGE: And you threw it out the window?
ELAINE: Mm-hmm.
GEORGE: God, you're like a rock star.
ELAINE: So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
JERRY: Because you threw it out.
ELAINE: No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
JERRY: But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
ELAINE: But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
JERRY: But that's you.
ELAINE: So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
(George, taking out his wallet to pay the check.)
GEORGE: Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
JERRY: Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
(George replacing his wallet in his pocket.)
GEORGE: This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
ELAINE: Look at you. You're on a slant.
GEORGE: Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
(He pulls some napkins out of the dispenser, puts them in his other back pocket, and becomes un-slanted)
GEORGE: There, there I'm fine.
(Suddenly, half of George's body falls with a crunch sound, as he becomes slanty the other way now)
JERRY: What was that?
GEORGE: I think I had some hard candy in there.
[George sees the delivery man bringing the massage chair into his apartment.]
GEORGE: No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
(George sits down in the chair.)
GEORGE: Ahhh. How does this thing work?
(George turns the chair on.)
GEORGE:Ahhhhh...
DELIVERY MAN: Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?
GEORGE: Ahhhhh...
[Keri meeting Jerry on the street. ]
KERI: Ready to go?
JERRY: All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
KERI: You don't go that often?
JERRY: No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
(Keri handing him a bunch of miscellaneous items that would seem to normally go in her purse.)
KERI: Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
JERRY: Compact, lipstick, all this?
(Keri, handing him a gigantic ring of keys.)
KERI: And can you help to carry my keys?
(Jerry looks at the keys.)
JERRY: What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
(Keri, handing him another item as she starts to walk down the street. )
KERI: And a tin of altoids.
(Jerry puts it all in his pocket and then trying to catch up to her)
JERRY: Ow! Sharp key.
[Kramer walks on the street with Newman]
KRAMER: So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?
NEWMAN: Well, there's very little sleeping going on.
KRAMER: Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
NEWMAN: Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.
KRAMER: Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
(Newman stops under a tree on the street and looking up into it.)
NEWMAN: Hey, what is that up that tree?
KRAMER: Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
NEWMAN: No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
(Kramer boosting Newman into the tree.)
KRAMER: Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
NEWMAN: The Pacific Northwest.
[Elaine with Jerry at his apartment.]
ELAINE: So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
JERRY: You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
(Elaine making a bowl of cereal.)
ELAINE: You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
JERRY: Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
ELAINE: No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
JERRY: I'm not carrying a purse.
(Elaine sits down at the table to eat her cereal.)
ELAINE: It's not a purse. It's European.
(Jerry sits down with Elaine.)
JERRY: Oh.
ELAINE: Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
(Jerry dialing his phone.)
JERRY: I don't know.
ELAINE: If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
(George answering his phone, while still using the massage chair.)
GEORGE: Yeah?
JERRY: Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
GEORGE: Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: It's in... transit.
ELAINE: Did he get it?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
GEORGE: (hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
JERRY: Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
GEORGE: Allllll right!
JERRY: What is that noise?
GEORGE: (hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
JERRY: You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
(Kramer enters Jerry's apartment and handing Jerry back his pliers.)
KRAMER: Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
ELAINE: Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
KRAMER: Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
ELAINE: What are you talking about?
KRAMER: Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
(Elaine pushing Kramer in her 'get-out!' style.)
ELAINE: 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
JERRY: What was that pop sound?
KRAMER: Well, I had some hard candy in there.
[Newman enters Elaine's apartment.]
NEWMAN: So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
(Elaine taking his coat and then throwing it on the floor.)
ELAINE: Come in, come in.
NEWMAN: Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.
ELAINE: Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
NEWMAN: This isn't about my opening your mail?
ELAINE: What?
NEWMAN: Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.
ELAINE: Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
NEWMAN: Sorry. Climbers, keepers.
ELAINE: You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
NEWMAN: You are?
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
NEWMAN: Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.
ELAINE: Ha ha ha ha.
NEWMAN: Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?
ELAINE: Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
NEWMAN: Cool?
ELAINE: Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
NEWMAN: Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.
ELAINE: All right, we're done here.
NEWMAN: For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be dancing on the sidewalk--
ELAINE: Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
[Keri putting her things into Jerry's carryal.]
KERI: Nice carryall.
JERRY: It's European.
KERI: Do you still have my lipstick?
JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
KERI: My job was to keep you away from the music.
JERRY: What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
KERI: Guess not.
JERRY: You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
[Silvio, running up and knocking on Kramer's door.]
SILVIO: Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.
KRAMER: Hey, Silvio!
(Silvio holding up a fur coat.)
SILVIO: Look at this.
KRAMER: Huh?
SILVIO: Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?
KRAMER: Relax, Silvio.
SILVIO: No, that's it. You're both out of the building!
KRAMER: Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
SILVIO: A man's?
KRAMER: Yeah.
SILVIO: What kind of a man would wear fur?
KRAMER: Oh, lots of 'em.
SILVIO: Would you?
KRAMER: No.
SILVIO: Then who?
KRAMER: What about Jerry?
SILVIO: Jerry?
KRAMER: Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
SILVIO: Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!
KRAMER: Yeah, something like that.
[Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.]
JERRY: I have to do what?
KRAMER: All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
JERRY: I'm not wearing the fur.
KRAMER: Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
JERRY: Is that right?
KRAMER: All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
JERRY: Newman, too?
KRAMER: Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
JERRY: That's my walkman!
KRAMER: And you'll get it back.
JERRY: All right.
KRAMER: All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
GEORGE: Hey.
KRAMER: Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
JERRY: George, did you get that chair yet?
GEORGE: It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
JERRY: You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
GEORGE: Excuse me?
JERRY: Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
GEORGE: Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
KRAMER: Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
GEORGE: He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
KRAMER: I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
GEORGE: Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
JERRY: No, you don't have to buy anything.
GEORGE: I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
JERRY: I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
GEORGE: I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
JERRY: Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
GEORGE: Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
JERRY: Your good friend is morbidly obese.
GEORGE: Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
JERRY: It's not a purse. It's European!
KRAMER: All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
JERRY: All right.
(Kramer puts the coat on Jerry.)
KRAMER: There you go.
JERRY: How do I look?
KRAMER: Ahh....
[George pulls down a tab from an ad he sees on the street.]
GEORGE: Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
(George puts the stub of paper in his wallet, and tries to close it, everything inside it flies out as the whole wallet explodes)
GEORGE: My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
[Outside on the Street in front of Jerry's]
JERRY: Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
SILVIO: That is your coat?
JERRY: It sure is.
SILVIO: Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.
JERRY: That's true.
(Kramer giving Jerry his carryal.)
KRAMER: Jerry, you forgot your purse.
JERRY: Oh, thanks.
KRAMER: Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
JERRY: Maybe this isn't my coat.
KRAMER: All right, you're not fancy!
SILVIO: No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!
(Elaine, coming up to them on the street.)
ELAINE: Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
JERRY: No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
ELAINE: No, that's not your coat.
SILVIO: If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?
ELAINE: It's Joe Mayo's coat.
SILVIO: Who's Joe Mayo?
KRAMER: That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
(A pickpocket runs by, taking Jerry's carryall, while everyone yells in surprise)
JERRY: Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
COP:: Your what?
JERRY: The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
COP:: You mean a purse?
JERRY: Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
[Jerry, on the phone with Elaine putting his things back into his wallet]
JERRY: So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
ELAINE: Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
JERRY: He should have had a reverse peephole.
(Puddy entering Elaine's apartment in a new bright, multi-colored leather coat.)
PUDDY: Hey, Babe.
(Elaine hangs up the phone to talk to Puddy.)
JERRY: Hello? Hello?
ELAINE: What is that?
PUDDY: It's my new coat.
ELAINE: You ditched the fur?
PUDDY: Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.
ELAINE: You're gonna wear this all the time?
PUDDY: All signs point to 'Yes!'
[Some street, Jerry and Kramer walking]
JERRY: So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
KRAMER: It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
JERRY: Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
(We see Sally from a distance.)
KRAMER: Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
JERRY: No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
KRAMER: Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!
JERRY: Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
KRAMER: Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
JERRY: She should just give up.
(She recognizes them.)
JERRY: Heeyyy!...
SALLY: Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from (?) Whoooooooo.....I'm on my way to an audition still waiting for that big break.
KRAMER: Why don't you just give up?
JERRY: Kramer!!!
KRAMER: At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
(Kramer leaves both Sally and Jerry speechless)
JERRY: So......Susan's dead.....
[At Monks]
KRAMER: I think she was happy someone finally said it.
JERRY: Why'd you have to say anything to her?
KRAMER: 'felt that the conversation was lagging.
JERRY: Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
KRAMER: I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
(Pushes Jerry out of the booth and leaves.)
ELAINE: You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
JERRY: What did you wanna be?
ELAINE: I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
JERRY: I don't either.
ELAINE: And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
(George comes in)
GEORGE: Hey!
ELAINE: Hey! George look at this.
GEORGE: That's cute.
ELAINE: You got it?
GEORGE: No, never mind.
ELAINE: Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
JERRY: It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
ELAINE: The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
GEORGE: Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
ELAINE: It's a page number.
GEORGE: Well, I can't crack this one.
ELAINE: Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
GEORGE: try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
JERRY: You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
GEORGE: Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
ELAINE: We know what a face consists of.
(Janet arrives)
JANET: I'm sorry I'm late.
GEORGE: Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
JANET: Nice to meet you.
ELAINE: Hi!
JANET: Do we still have time to make the movie?
GEORGE: Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
(George goes to the cashier and empties out the candy bowl, they leave.)
ELAINE: Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
JERRY: She does not.
ELAINE: Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
[Jerry's place, Kramer is already there making himself a lunch.]
JERRY: Hey! Kramer.
KRAMER: hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
JERRY: What! You're the one who ruined her life.
KRAMER: Well that's not how she remembers it.
JERRY: Well, I got to talk her out of this.
KRAMER: I thought you said she stinks
JERRY: She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
(Door buzzer rings)
JERRY: Yeah...
GEORGE: Hey! George and Janet.
KRAMER: Aahh...Who's Janet?
JERRY: George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
KRAMER: You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
ALL: Hey, Hey!
KRAMER: And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
GEORGE: Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
JANET: well maybe we do look a little like each other.
GEORGE: No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
KRAMER: C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
GEORGE: (nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
JANET: We just got here George
GEORGE: Well,,, it's getting dark.
(They leave.)
KRAMER: yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
(Jerry slaps him in the back.)
JERRY: What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
KRAMER: Well how should I have "broached the subject"
JERRY: You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
KRAMER: Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
JERRY: Yeah! Because of you.
KRAMER: Well, I think one of us should leave.
(They stare at each other for a while)
[Monks]
JERRY: Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
SALLY: (nods) Hehumm!!
JERRY: You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
SALLY: Really?
JERRY: Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
SALLY: Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties.
JERRY: All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
SALLY: Right!, Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. (starts to eat her food)
JERRY: NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
[Back to Jerry's place, evening.]
ELAINE: Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
JERRY: Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
ELAINE: (to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
GEORGE: What does that mean?
JERRY: Yeah. What does that mean?
GEORGE: (to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
ELAINE: Enjoy. (she leaves)
JERRY: Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
GEORGE: Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
JERRY: No....
GEORGE: Why would I...
JERRY: It's ludicrous..
GEORGE: Yes.
JERRY: For either one of us..
GEORGE: No...
JERRY: So...
GEORGE: Exactly.
JERRY: I'm not gay.
GEORGE: ...neither am I.
BOTH: Kramer, Kramer, get in here.
GEORGE: Where's the crazy man, Come on up.
JERRY: Come on in here.
(As Kramer steps out and comes in)
GEORGE: Haaaaaa!!!
JERRY: What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
KRAMER: I've made an important life decision.
JERRY: Lets talk about that.
GEORGE: Don't leave (George slams the door)
KRAMER: Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
GEORGE: What's the decision?
KRAMER: I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
JERRY: Yeah right.
KRAMER: What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
GEORGE: Silence YES!!
JERRY: Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
KRAMER: Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
(Kramer does mimics but you can make out somebody angry saying "What are you talking about, twice and then some crying))
JERRY: Well what does this mean?
KRAMER: Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
GEORGE: (frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
KRAMER: That's the idea.
JERRY: Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
KRAMER: (makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
JERRY: Oh! you just startin' now?
KRAMER: that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
(Kramer turns abruptly and hit his knees on the coffee table)
KRAMER: Ouch!!..........Now!!
[Next day at the New Yorker]
MR. ELINOFF: So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?
ELAINE: Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
(Elaine shows him the cartoon)
MR. ELINOFF: Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.
ELAINE: Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
MR. ELINOFF: Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..
ELAINE: Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
MR. ELINOFF: Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. (slides the magazine to her)
ELAINE: But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
MR. ELINOFF: It's a slice of life.
ELAINE: No it isn't.
MR. ELINOFF: Pun?
ELAINE: I don,t think so.
MR. ELINOFF: Vorshtein?
ELAINE: That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
MR. ELINOFF: No.
ELAINE: Then why did you print it.
MR. ELINOFF: I liked the kitty.
ELAINE: (gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
MR. ELINOFF: Actually that's not bad..
ELAINE: Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
[Cuts to the Samuel Beckett Theatre]
JERRY: Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
SALLY: No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me,oKay, a tear.
(Kramer joins Jerry just as the show starts)
JERRY: Ah! There you are.(Kramer motions silence)
JERRY: Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
(Applause, Sally starts her show)
SALLY: Hi everybody think you're really going to like this 'cos it' about me...All right it's not just about me It's about me and this guy; Jerry Seinfeld. who I like to call; The Devil...Okay, Okay so.. I run into this Jerry on the street and he says to me " Sally, You stink, You should give up acting." Oh! I'm doing Jerry Now so you've got imagine I have ; horns, a tail and hooks instead of feet. (big laughs from the audience and Kramer is cracking up)
JERRY: (to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
[Next day at Jerry's]
ELAINE: She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
JERRY: Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
ELAINE: Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
JERRY: The New Yorker?
ELAINE: Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
JERRY: Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew
ELAINE: Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
JERRY: Nodding off...
ELAINE: ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
JERRY: Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
ELAINE: I do to.
JERRY: What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
ELAINE: It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
JERRY: Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
[Back to Monks, same day]
SALLY: Jerry, sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?
JERRY: No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
SALLY: Well...That is the title.
JERRY: I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
SALLY: You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think... It's all a journey.
JERRY: You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
(Newman shyly approaches the table)
NEWMAN: Excuse me Miss Weaver, OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..
JERRY: What a surprise.
NEWMAN: Aahh! You're great,It's great, It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
(Kramer climbs into a cab)
DRIVER: Where to?
(Kramer realizes that he can't talk so quickly gets out of the cab.)
[Evening at Janet's apt.]
GEORGE: (we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
SALLY: You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.
GEORGE: I know....
[Back to Jerry's]
TV ANNOUNCER: Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show.
SALLY: Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like "Hey stop doing your show." and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes." Okay Shmootsie" and he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting, you know, Hands Across America.
JERRY: There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
SALLY: ...And this is what he looks like when he's eating...
JERRY: Get Out of my House!!.
(Elaine walks in the door looking terrible)
ELAINE: Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
JERRY: I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
ELAINE: That is not the point.
JERRY: some mouthwash, a hat, something.
ELAINE: Just read it!
JERRY: (glances at it) Pretty good.
ELAINE: Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
JERRY: It's a pig at a complain department.
ELAINE: And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
JERRY: I get it.
ELAINE: Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
JERRY: How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
ELAINE: Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
JERRY: I'm a comedian.
ELAINE: I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
JERRY: Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
ELAINE: I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
JERRY: oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
(Picks up a phone and dials Sally's number. Kramer taps on a sheet of paper that he gives to Elaine to read.)
ELAINE: The pig says "my wife is a slut."
JERRY: Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
(Instant switch to the club where Sally is playing the message that Jerry left on her message.)
JERRY: ....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
JERRY: (from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
(Still Sally's act but seen on his TV back in his apartment.)
SALLY: To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer. Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld...(censored beep)...You
JERRY: How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
[At Peterman's office, next day. Elaine posted her cartoon on her door.]
ELAINE: Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
PETERMAN: Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.
ELAINE: Can I fix that after lunch sir?
PETERMAN: Oh! no right away, chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh) I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)
ELAINE: (to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
DUGAN: You shouldn't make fun of pigs. (he leaves)
PETERMAN: (returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.
ELAINE: Oh! Do tell sir?
PETERMAN: It's a Ziggy!
ELAINE: A Ziggy?
PETERMAN: That irreverence, that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine, to my archives.
[In a restaurant later that evening.]
GEORGE: You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
JANET: It's not?
GEORGE: No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
JANET: I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party.
GEORGE: ....But after that we really talked didn't we?
JANET: Well,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before.
GEORGE: Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
JANET: You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.
GEORGE: Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
JANET: I like gum.
GEORGE: I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
JANET: I have gum in my hair.
GEORGE: I'm losin' it
[Monks]
SALLY: (joining Kramer) Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy, mind if I sit. My show is going really well. Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day, How weird is that. I know . At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back, Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean. But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman, Sally Weaver the artist, Sally Weaver the person...
KRAMER: (loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
SALLY: Well, lay it on me string bean.
[Janet's apt. She is in the bedroom.]
JANET: Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready for bed.
GEORGE: OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
JANET: George.
(George turns around to see Janet with short Jerry like hair and a jerry like blue shirt.)
GEORGE: Your hair?
JANET: Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed George. (George speeds out the door)
GEORGE: George is in big trouble....
[At Jerry's the next day.]
JERRY: You ripped off a Ziggy?
ELAINE: It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
JERRY: I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
(Kramer comes in)
ELAINE: Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
JERRY: Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
SALLY: (on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.
JERRY: That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
ELAINE: Why are you yelling at the TV?
SALLY: ..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues..
JERRY: Elaine, have you been talking to her?
ELAINE: Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
SALLY: Oh and speaking of issues . Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his neighbor not to tell anyone?
JERRY: (to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
KRAMER: ...All right ..Starting now......
[Monks]
JERRY: You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
GEORGE: like that (looking at Jerry)
JERRY: You mean like.. (points to his hair)
GEORGE: ..That.
JERRY: So she..
GEORGE: Yes..
JERRY: And you don't...
GEORGE: Nooo...
JERRY: So...
GEORGE: Exactly..
JERRY: Hmmmm...
GEORGE: We...must never ever speak of this again..
JERRY: No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
GEORGE: Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
JERRY: I think that's for the best.
[George's apartment - Maura brings two cups over and sits down next to George]
GEORGE: (clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
MAURA: No. (sips her drink)
GEORGE: (double takes) What's that?
MAURA: We're not breaking up. (takes another sip)
GEORGE: (puzzled) W-we're not?
MAURA: No. (hands George his cup)
(George is rendered speechless. He considers this for a while. Finally...)
GEORGE: All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
[Monk's - Jerry and George]
JERRY: She said no?
GEORGE: She said no.
JERRY: What did you do?
GEORGE: What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
JERRY: George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
GEORGE: Well, I don't really like her.
JERRY: That's good.
GEORGE: I don't find her attractive.
JERRY: Solid.
GEORGE: I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
JERRY: Always popular.
GEORGE: Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food: 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
JERRY: You have an airtight case!
GEORGE: And in bed--
JERRY: I'm afraid we're out of time.
(George pulls an annoyed face. Jerry takes a sip from his cup then, remembering something, pulls out a jewellery case)
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
GEORGE: I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
JERRY: No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
GEORGE: You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
JERRY: Oh, that'll intrigue him.
GEORGE: Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
JERRY: George Peppard has been dead for years.
GEORGE: Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
[Day. Street - Elaine is sat outside a cafe with a man, Glenn]
GLENN: So you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
ELAINE: Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
GLENN: So, um, why don't we get together some time?
ELAINE: Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
GLENN: I think it'd be better if I called you.
ELAINE: Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
GLENN: Mm mm... no, not really.
ELAINE: So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
GLENN: (seductive tone) I think you're very beautiful.
ELAINE: (flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
[Jerry's apartment - Jerry and Elaine]
JERRY: What about Puddy?
ELAINE: I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
JERRY: (unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?
ELAINE: I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
JERRY: Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
ELAINE: Which one is he?
JERRY: Green suit, power ring.
ELAINE: I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
(Kramer enters carrying a box)
KRAMER: Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
JERRY: So you bought a cooler?
KRAMER: No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
ELAINE: And... what would those be?
KRAMER: Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
JERRY: (doubtful) You were in the Army?
KRAMER: Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
ELAINE: Literally.
KRAMER: (offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
JERRY: No, go ahead.
KRAMER: (stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
JERRY: Oh, come on!
ELAINE: Oh!
KRAMER: Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
JERRY: (walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
KRAMER: Well, that's classified.
(Kramer slams the door behind Jerry and Elaine as they enter the hallway)
ELAINE: Hey, what if he's married?
JERRY: Kramer?!
ELAINE: No, the Green Lantern.
KRAMER: (from inside) OK!
(Jerry and Elaine re-enter the apartment. Kramer is now sat on the couch with his strongbox, flicking through a magazine)
JERRY: So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
(Jerry, getting a spoon out of his silverware drawer, accidentally finds the key, and holds it up for Kramer to see)
KRAMER: (bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
JERRY: THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs)
KRAMER: It was under a spoon!
(Jerry discards the key, unimpressed)
[George's apartment - George is standing, holding a notebook. Maura sits there, listening]
GEORGE: And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
(George stands there holding the door open)
MAURA: No, George, we're not.
GEORGE: (gestures towards book) But I proved it!
MAURA: I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like... launching missiles from a submarine. Both of us have to turn our keys.
GEORGE: Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
MAURA: (assertive) I'm sorry, George, I can't do that.
GEORGE: (shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
[Day. Elaine & Glenn walking on the street]
ELAINE: So, how is a guy like you not involved?
GLENN: I might ask you the same thing.
ELAINE: (in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
(Glenn gives her a flower he's just taken from outside a store)
ELAINE: Oh, that is so sweet.
ELAINE: (in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
GLENN: (seeing a woman on the street) Oh, no.
ELAINE: Who is it?
GLENN: Um, uh, no one, no one. (running with Elaine into an alley) Here, uh, let me show you a short cut. Come on. Come on.
ELAINE: (in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
[Day. On street outside Jerry's apartment]
ELAINE: (shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
(Jerry opens his window and looks down)
JERRY: Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
ELAINE: You didn't hear me buzzing?
JERRY: Oh, I guess it's broken!
ELAINE: Throw down your key.
JERRY: It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
ELAINE: I'll catch it!
JERRY: You'll chicken out at the last second.
ELAINE: ...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
JERRY: (annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
ELAINE: Huh?
JERRY: I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
ELAINE: Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
(to a passer-by who gives her a disapproving look) We haven't done anything yet. (sighs) I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?
JERRY: All right.
(cut to inside of Jerry's apartment)
JERRY: Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
(Jerry throws down a granola bar and walks away from the window)
ELAINE: (from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
(Jerry opens up his buzzer and finds the problem. Kramer bursts in)
JERRY: Hey...
KRAMER: (re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
JERRY: (waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
KRAMER: (grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
JERRY: I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
KRAMER: Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
JERRY: (in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
KRAMER: (from inside) Security issue!
(Elaine arrives)
JERRY: Oh, hey. You got in.
ELAINE: Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
JERRY: (taking the menus) Oh, thanks.
KRAMER: (clattering inside) That wasn't me!
JERRY: So, he's definitely married, huh?
ELAINE: Uh...
JERRY: Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
(Elaine splutters guiltily)
JERRY: Oh, come on!
ELAINE: Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
KRAMER: (from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens)
(Elaine and Jerry re-enter the apartment, while Kramer holds the door)
KRAMER: All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
GEORGE: (from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
(George puts his fingers in mouth and tries unsuccessfully to whistle)
JERRY: (out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
JERRY: (putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
KRAMER: Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
[Lobby of Jerry's building - Jerry emerges from the elevator and walks towards the door. George is behind the glass eating a granola bar. Jerry stares in disgust at it]
JERRY: (opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
GEORGE: (puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
Phil: (walking up to get inside after George) Thanks.
JERRY: (barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
PHIL: What?
JERRY: There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
PHIL: But, I live here! I ran out to buy some birdseed, and-and I forgot my key.
GEORGE: Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
JERRY: (shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
(George and Jerry head towards the elevator)
GEORGE: So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
JERRY: Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
GEORGE: Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
JERRY: Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
GEORGE: (looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
JERRY: Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
JERRY: We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
GEORGE: Want a bite?
JERRY: Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)
[Night. George's apartment - George is lazing on the couch, with a magazine, rubbing an apple on his sweater]
GEORGE: (in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
MAURA: (cheerily) Hey, Honey. (she sweeps in, shuts the door behind her, and sits down)
GEORGE: (still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
MAURA: George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight.
GEORGE: Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
MAURA: George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner.
GEORGE: (pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
MAURA: (picking up the apple) Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot. (George freezes, shakes his head, and continues walking)
[Glenn's apartment - squalid, with barely any furniture]
ELAINE: So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
GLENN: It's nothing special, just a little place I keep.
ELAINE: Oh.
GLENN: Ah, should I light a fire?
ELAINE: Oh, that sounds... romantic.
GLENN: I'm having a little problem with the heat. Um, I got some cardboard out here. (climbing through the window)
ELAINE: (in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
GLENN: (leaning in) Can you get that, please?
ELAINE: Oh, sure.
(Elaine opens the door to see the woman from the street that Glenn avoided earlier. Elaine gasps)
WOMAN: Where's Glenn?
ELAINE: (guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
WOMAN: Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?
ELAINE: This is his home?
WOMAN: Yes.
ELAINE: So, he's...
WOMAN: (nodding) Poor. (Elaine mouths 'oo')
GLENN: (coming back through the window carrying an old chair) I think this will burn!
[Jerry's building lobby - Jerry gets into the elevator and is about to press the button when Phil walks in. Jerry's jaw drops. Both men carry a bag of groceries]
JERRY: So you do live here.
PHIL: (sulkily) Yeah. (Jerry has an anguished expression as the elevator doors shut)
(Going up in the elevator, both men stand awkwardly in the silence, facing forward. Jerry looks troubled. Phil peeks up to check the progress of the elevator. Finally, it arrives, the doors open and Jerry exits, and starts to wave goodbye to Phil but sees him also exiting)
JERRY: You live on this floor?
PHIL: Yeah.
JERRY: (arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
PHIL: Yeah. (enters his apartment)
JERRY: So I guess I'll s--
(Phil slams the door behind him. Jerry nods and enters his own apartment)
[Day. Monk's - Elaine sits opposite Jerry at a booth]
ELAINE: He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
JERRY: Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
ELAINE: He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
JERRY: So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
ELAINE: How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
JERRY: Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
ELAINE: Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
JERRY: Good. How did you handle that?
ELAINE: Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
JERRY: Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
ELAINE: Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
GEORGE: (entering Monk's) Hey.
JERRY: Hey, where have you been?
GEORGE: (sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
ELAINE: If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
GEORGE: Who's this, Blue Arrow?
ELAINE: Green Lantern.
JERRY: We found out his super power was lack of money.
ELAINE: (not amused) All right.
JERRY: He's invulnerable to creditors.
ELAINE: (annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
JERRY: He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
ELAINE: Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
GEORGE: Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
ELAINE: (leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
GEORGE: Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
JERRY: Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
GEORGE: She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
JERRY: (fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
(George makes a face and reluctantly switches sides, to the seat Elaine was in)
GEORGE: Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
JERRY: Really? How come you never pursued her before?
GEORGE: She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
ELAINE: (coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
JERRY: (to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
ELAINE: (leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
[Day. Jerry's apartment — Jerry enters to find Kramer there. A squawking can be heard in the hallway)
KRAMER: Heh.
JERRY: There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
KRAMER: It's Phil's.
JERRY: Who?
KRAMER: Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
JERRY: What'd ya tell him that for?
KRAMER: Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
JERRY: Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
KRAMER: Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
JERRY: He let you?
KRAMER: No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
(Kramer leaves. We hear squawking and screaming and a banging against the door as Kramer's presumably attacked by the bird. Then he bursts back in, shaken and checking his face for blood. He shuts the door with his foot and peers through the peephole)
[Night. George's apartment - he enters with a too-tanned Loretta, who is carrying flowers]
GEORGE: So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
LORETTA: I was in Maine for a couple days. (George looks puzzled at how she's so tanned)
GEORGE: Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
LORETTA: George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you.
GEORGE: (excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
LORETTA: But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon.
GEORGE: (walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
LORETTA: I want to build something with you, George.
GEORGE: Oh, not more building.
LORETTA: (sighs) And I won't take no for an answer. (she sits down)
GEORGE: No?
LORETTA: No.
GEORGE: (after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
[Day. Alley]
ELAINE: So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
GLENN: It's a surprise.
ELAINE: (giggling) Oh.
(A nearby door opens, and a cook throws a garbage bag out into a trash can. As soon as the cook is gone, Glenn makes a grab for the bag and starts looking inside it)
ELAINE: What are you doing? What is that?
GLENN: It's a bag of donuts.
ELAINE: It's garbage.
GLENN: No, no, no, no. When they make the new ones, the old ones come out... right here.
ELAINE: (has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
GLENN: (still looking through the garbage bag) It's a bear claw! You have no idea how rare this is.
ELAINE: (writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
GLENN: (eating the bear claw) Oooh!
ELAINE: Make it three hundred.
GLENN: (re the bear claw) You know, Elaine, you're the bear claw in the garbage bag of my life. (breaks bear claw in half and offers her a piece)
ELAINE: (touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.
(the cook comes out again, dumping a bucket of water out in the alley, and splashing Elaine and Glenn as they share the bear claw, but they're too wrapped up with each other to take much notice. Elaine wipes the side of her face. They smile)
[Phil's apartment. A woman wearing cleaning gloves and a headscarf and carrying a wastebasket goes to open the door. Jerry is standing there)
JERRY: Hi. Is Phil here?
Phil: (from inside the apartment) Yeah, I'm here. (comes to the door. The caged parrot is visible in the background)
JERRY: Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
PHIL: And?
JERRY: I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
PHIL: That's my wife.
JERRY: (nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
[Day. Jerry's apartment - Jerry and George]
JERRY: (in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
GEORGE: This isn't going well.
JERRY: I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
GEORGE: You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
JERRY: Where are you goin'? Help me look!
GEORGE: (opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
JERRY: Which is with who?
GEORGE: (shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
KRAMER: (entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
JERRY: I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
KRAMER: Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
JERRY: You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
KRAMER: Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
(entering the hall, Jerry and Kramer see Phil and his wife, both crying, arriving at their apartment. Jerry and Kramer approach them)
KRAMER: Hey, what's going on?
PHIL: Fredo is dead. (his wife sobs)
JERRY: That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
PHIL: No! My bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery. (starts opening door)
JERRY: Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
PHIL: Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his food.
JERRY: But I, I didn't, I--
(Phil slams the door on Jerry. Kramer pats Jerry reassuringly on the shoulder)
JERRY: Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
KRAMER: Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
JERRY: Just get the key and let's get out of here.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
JERRY: Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: You killed Fredo!
KRAMER: (high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
JERRY: Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
(Kramer clicks his fingers and points at Jerry)
KRAMER: You just answered your own question.
JERRY: (frowning in realization) Oh, no!
KRAMER: (nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
[Day. Monk's - George and Loretta]
GEORGE: The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
LORETTA: (shaking head, confused) What?
GEORGE: I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
LORETTA: Oh. (she smiles, reassured, and nods)
(Maura enters)
MAURA: George?
GEORGE: Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
MAURA: You told me to meet you here for lunch.
GEORGE: (standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
MAURA: (calmly ignoring George) I'm Maura. (shaking Loretta's hand and smiling)
LORETTA: (to Maura, also friendly) I'm Loretta. You want to join us? (Maura nods and sits down next to her)
GEORGE: (laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
MAURA: George, what we have is too important. We can work through this.
LORETTA: So can we.
GEORGE: (astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
MAURA: No.
GEORGE: You?
LORETTA: No.
(George stands there pondering this, then resignedly...)
GEORGE: All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
[Glenn's apartment - Elaine and Glenn]
GLENN: Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo?
ELAINE: Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
(A woman walks in)
GLENN: Oh, my God, Alison. You're home early.
ELAINE: Who is this?
ALISON: (arms crossed, angry) His wife.
ELAINE: You're... poor AND married?
GLENN: Looks like it.
ALISON: Who the hell are you?
ELAINE: I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
[Night. Pet Cemetery - Jerry and Kramer enter, dressed in their tuxedos. Jerry is carrying a shovel]
JERRY: Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
KRAMER: (reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
JERRY: (seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
KRAMER: (sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
JERRY: (grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
KRAMER: Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
(Kramer walks off, trips over a tombstone, straightens his bow-tie, trying to appear dignified again, and exits. Jerry, watching, shakes his head and starts digging)
JERRY: (hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
(cut to another part of the cemetery, where Phil is walking with his wife. She is carrying flowers)
PHIL: All right, Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace.
(back to Jerry, levering the metal box out of the ground. Kramer is not back)
JERRY: (with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
(just at that moment, Phil and his wife arrive)
PHIL: (horrified) Oh, my God!
(Phil's wife screams and puts her hand to her mouth in shock)
JERRY: (after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
[Jerry's apartment - George, Elaine, Jerry, and Kramer in the background. George is counting bank notes into two piles]
GEORGE: All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
ELAINE: Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
(Elaine makes a face at George as though picking something from her teeth with her tongue. George rolls his eyes away, returning to the money)
ELAINE: (to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
JERRY: (still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
(Kramer enters from the bathroom, also still in his tuxedo, without the tie. George gets up and walks over to the strongbox)
GEORGE: So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
(Kramer gasps. He and Jerry look on in amazement)
KRAMER: Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
JERRY: You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
KRAMER: Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
[Monk's]
GEORGE: When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
JERRY: It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
GEORGE: How much was it?
JERRY: Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
GEORGE: Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
JERRY: Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
GEORGE: I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
JERRY: Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
GEORGE: At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
JERRY: Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
ELAINE: (entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
DARRYL: Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later.
ELAINE: OK.
JERRY: Still no Puddy?
ELAINE: Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
JERRY: What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
ELAINE: What black guy?
JERRY: Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
ELAINE: He is?
GEORGE: No, he isn't.
JERRY: Isn't he, Elaine?
ELAINE: You think?
GEORGE: I thought he looked Irish.
JERRY: What's his last name?
ELAINE: Nelson.
GEORGE: That's not Irish.
JERRY: I think he's black.
GEORGE: Should we be talkin' about this?
ELAINE: I think it's OK.
GEORGE: No, it isn't.
JERRY: Why not?
GEORGE: Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
JERRY: If he's black.
ELAINE: Is he black?
JERRY: Does it matter?
ELAINE: No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
JERRY: Oh, so you need to know?
ELAINE: No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
WAITRESS: Should I take that?
JERRY: (getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
ELAINE: (looking in her purse) Oh, here.
GEORGE: (pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
(when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly get out lots of money for her tip)
[Jerry's Apartment]
GEORGE: (on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
MRS. ROSS: Uh, who?
GEORGE: George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
MR. ROSS: (walking by Mrs. Ross) We're all out of lime juice. I told that woman to buy more.
MRS. ROSS: Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this weekend.
GEORGE: Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
MR. ROSS: (again walking by) I'm goin' back to bed.
MRS. ROSS: Thank you for calling, George.
GEORGE: Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
JERRY: House in the Hamptons?
GEORGE: Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
KRAMER: (enters) Well.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
JERRY: Wow. What are we celebrating?
KRAMER: Uh, you remember my coffee table book?
JERRY: With the little legs?
KRAMER: That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
GEORGE: How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
KRAMER: You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
GEORGE: Yeah?
KRAMER: Independence Day?
GEORGE: Oh.
JERRY: How much are they payin' you?
KRAMER: Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
JERRY: That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
KRAMER: Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
JERRY: From what?
KRAMER: From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
JERRY: (seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
KRAMER: Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
JERRY & GEORGE: Ooh!
KRAMER: Well, it's not really gold.
JERRY & GEORGE: Aww.
[Darryl's Apartment]
(approaching Darryl's apartment, Elaine hears loud rap music being played, and smiles knowingly)
ELAINE: (as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
DARRYL: Hey.
ELAINE: Great music.
DARRYL: Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day. I hate it.
DARRYL: Yo, you! Turn it down!
ELAINE: Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
DARRYL: They're... African.
ELAINE: Right. African.
DARRYL: Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa.
ELAINE: South Africa.
DARRYL: My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for obvious reasons. You know how it is.
ELAINE: Maybe.
[Street]
GEORGE: (to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
(the Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street, observe George not being in the Hamptons, and move on)
GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
VENDER: Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?
GEORGE: Mmm... no.
[Florida- Seinfeld Condo]
MORTY: (Jerry comes out of his room, having just woken up) Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!
JERRY: It's 5:30 in the morning!
HELEN: We let you sleep in.
JERRY: (handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
MORTY: Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents.
JERRY: What does that mean?
HELEN: Leave your father alone. It's his birthday.
MORTY: Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector.
JERRY: Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
MORTY: This looks like too much money.
JERRY: Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
MORTY: You think it's hot?
JERRY: Could be.
MORTY: Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!
HELEN: I'm right here.
JERRY: And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
MORTY: So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?
JERRY: Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
MORTY: Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips.
HELEN: Jerry, you're getting your father too excited.
KRAMER: (entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
JERRY: Kramer, what are you doing here?
KRAMER: I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
HELEN: Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment.
KRAMER: Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
JERRY: Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
JERRY: (getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
HELEN: Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?
KRAMER: Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.
JERRY: If you feed him, he'll never leave.
HELEN: We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?
KRAMER: (immaturely) I guess.
JERRY: I can't believe this.
KRAMER: I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
[Monk's]
ELAINE: So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
GEORGE: Actually, I did have a thought.
ELAINE: Oh.
GEORGE: Why don't you just ask him?
ELAINE: (rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
GEORGE: Maybe he's, um... mixed.
ELAINE: Is that the right word?
GEORGE: I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: (standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
ELAINE: (starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
GEORGE: Yeah.
ELAINE: I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
MRS. ROSS: Oh, you're George's friend.
MR. ROSS: We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his place in the Hamptons?
ELAINE: (laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
GEORGE: Rosses.
MR. ROSS: George, we were just talking about you.
GEORGE: Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
MRS. ROSS: Really?
GEORGE: Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
[Florida- Restaurant]
MORTY: (eating lunch with Helen and Jerry) Another fine meal, and now for my Wizard tip calculator.
JERRY: Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
MORTY: Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions. (trying to open it) I can't get it open.
(Jerry easily opens it)
HELEN: Yay! Jerry got it open.
MORTY: The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water. How does 12.4% sound?
JERRY: (looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
MORTY: We'll round down.
HELEN: Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections.
JERRY: Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
MORTY: I was never impeached! I resigned!
HELEN: Even so, the press would bury him!
JERRY: What press?
HELEN: The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze.
MORTY: Pinko Commie rag.
[Florida- clubhouse]
OLD MAN: (coming up to the three Seinfelds) Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he just got a date with that young aquacise instructor.
JERRY: She's fifty.
OLD MAN: You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man.
KRAMER: All right, I'll see you guys.
OLD MAN: Yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next to him, staring at his face)
KRAMER: (taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
MORTY: I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.
KRAMER: Hmm.
[Darryl's Apartment]
DARRYL: Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!
(Elaine laughts somewhat awkwardly)
DARRYL: Wow, it's got so many functions.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
DARRYL: Well, I don't do that stuff.
ELAINE: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one: race.
DARRYL: Isn't that optional?
ELAINE: It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
DARRYL: All right, I'm... Asian.
ELAINE: What?
DARRYL: Just to mess with 'em.
ELAINE: laughing awkwardly: Oh. Right. Good one.
DARRYL: Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand.
ELAINE: Really?
DARRYL: Does that matter?
ELAINE: No, but... it is very nice to know.
[Florida- Seinfeld Condo]
JERRY: (in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
ELAINE: (in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
JERRY: (as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
ELAINE: Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
JERRY: Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
(Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry to hand him a magazine from the table)
JERRY: He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
ELAINE: Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
JERRY: Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
GEORGE: (entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
ELAINE: (to George) He's still down with his folks.
GEORGE: (to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
JERRY: (overhearing the other two: Elaine, Elaine--
ELAINE: (to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
JERRY: (overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
GEORGE: (to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
ELAINE: (to George) Mm-hmm.
GEORGE: (taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
JERRY: George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
ELAINE: (trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
GEORGE: What about the mail?
JERRY: This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
GEORGE: (hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
[Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: So, I ran into the Rosses again.
ELAINE: Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
GEORGE: From me.
ELAINE: What did you say?
GEORGE: I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
ELAINE: I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
GEORGE: So, they knew? Those liars!
ELAINE: But you lied first.
GEORGE: Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
ELAINE: Like you're a liar!
GEORGE: Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
ELAINE: So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
GEORGE: Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
ELAINE: Haven't you done enough to these people?
GEORGE: This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
(Elaine gets a sarcastic, 'oh, boy' expression)
[Florida- Kramer Campaigning]
KRAMER: (to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
OLD WOMAN: Will you cut my meat?
KRAMER: Gladly.
[Monk's]
WAITRESS: (to Darryl) Coffee?
DARRYL: Sure.
WAITRESS: (to Darryl) Are you black? Or should I bring some cream.
DARRYL: I'm black. (re-thinking) Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream. (seeing a couple gesturing towards him and Elaine) Did you hear that?
ELAINE: What?
DARRYL: God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial couple.
ELAINE: Interracial? Us?
DARRYL: Isn't that unbelievable!?
ELAINE: Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
DARRYL: I don't feel like eating.
ELAINE: Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
[Outside the Ross']
GEORGE: So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
MRS. ROSS: Sounds grand.
GEORGE: Do you have your bathing suits?
MR. ROSS: It's March.
GEORGE: Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
[Florida-Seinfeld Condo]
JERRY: (in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
KRAMER: Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
MORTY: (coming into the hall) This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the election!
KRAMER: Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
JERRY: You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
MORTY: Daily what?
HELEN: (coming into the condo) Have you read today's Boca Breeze?
KRAMER: (looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
MORTY: Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the rules.
KRAMER: Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
JERRY: Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
HELEN: Who wants hot chocolate?
KRAMER: Oh, yeah! Me.
MORTY: This is a huge scandal! We need damage control.
KRAMER: All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
JERRY: Wizards!
KRAMER: Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
JERRY: Kramer...
MORTY: There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that deal.
KRAMER: Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
MORTY: (rushing to his bedroom) First, I need a nap.
HELEN: (running after him) Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!
JERRY: Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
KRAMER: Well, what about your deal, huh?
JERRY: I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
KRAMER: Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
JERRY: Down here?
KRAMER: Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
[George's Car]
George, driving in the car with the Rosses) And that leads into the master bedroom.
MRS. ROSS: Tell us more.
GEORGE: You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
MR. ROSS: Another solarium?
GEORGE: Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
MR. ROSS: What are their names?
GEORGE: Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
MRS. ROSS: Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a housewarming gift.
GEORGE: (chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
[Monk's]
WAITRESS: (handing Elaine a menu) Here you go.
ELAINE: (to the black waitress) Long day?
WAITRESS: Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.
ELAINE: I hear ya, Sister.
WAITRESS: Sister?
ELAINE: (as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
DARRYL: Hi, Elaine.
ELAINE: Hey.
WAITRESS: He's black?
ELAINE: Yeah.
DARRYL: I'm black?
ELAINE: Aren't you?
WAITRESS: (leaving) I'll give you a couple minutes to decide.
DARRYL: What are you talking about?
ELAINE: You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
DARRYL: We are. Because you're Hispanic.
ELAINE: I am?
DARRYL: Aren't you?
ELAINE: No. Why would you think that?
DARRYL: Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those Spanish restaurants.
ELAINE: That's because I thought you were black.
DARRYL: Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?
ELAINE: I don't think we should be talking about this.
DARRYL: So, what are you?
ELAINE: I'm white.
DARRYL: So, we're just a couple of white people?
ELAINE: I guess.
DARRYL: Oh.
ELAINE: Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
DARRYL: (leaving with Elaine) Sure.
[Florida-Seinfeld Condo]
KRAMER: (having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
JERRY: Aw.
MORTY: Congratulations, Mr. President.
KRAMER: Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.
OLD MAN: Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?
MORTY: What are you talking about?
OLD MAN: It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT.
MORTY: This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard.
JERRY: A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!
OLD MAN #2: Mine doesn't have a seven!
OLD MAN #3: I'm ruined!
MORTY: Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?
JERRY: Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
MORTY: You didn't have a deal?
JERRY: No deal. Not hot.
OLD MAN: Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished.
KRAMER: What?
OLD MAN: Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.
KRAMER: (getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
JERRY: Dad, I'm sorry.
MORTY: You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip calculator?!
JERRY: It does other things!
[Outside George's Car on a beach]
MR. ROSS: Where are we, George?
GEORGE: Almost there.
MR. ROSS: Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?
GEORGE: We, uh, we go on foot from here.
MR. ROSS: All right.
GEORGE: There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
MR. ROSS: We know.
GEORGE: Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
MRS. ROSS: We don't like you, George.
MR. ROSS: And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan.
GEORGE: Oh.
MR. ROSS: All right! Let's head back.
[Elaine is getting ready to drive Puddy's car, he's giving her last minute instructions.]
PUDDY: Alright, be careful with the car, babe.
ELAINE: Yeah, yeah.
PUDDY: And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.
ELAINE: Goodbye?
PUDDY: Two and ten, babe.
ELAINE: Okay.
PUDDY: Don't peel out.
ELAINE: I won't.
(Elaine peels out and turns on the car stereo. She hears: "Jesus is one, Jesus is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall..." Elaine changes the stations but all of the presets are set to religious radio stations; "And he said unto Abraham...", "Amen! Amen!", "So we pray...", "Saved!", "Jey-sus!" She turns off the radio.)
ELAINE: Jesus?
[Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.]
KRUGER: According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?
GEORGE: Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
KRUGER: Works for me. Good thinking, George.
CO-WORKER #1: Alright, George.
CO-WORKER #2: Way to go man.
GEORGE: Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
KRUGER: Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.
CO-WORKER #1: Good one.
CO-WORKER #2: That was bad.
[George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.]
GEORGE: I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
JERRY: And then?
GEORGE: I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
JERRY: Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
GEORGE: I can't just leave.
JERRY: That's the way they do it in Vegas.
GEORGE: You never played Vegas.
JERRY: I hear things.
(Elaine enters and has a seat.)
ELAINE: Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
GEORGE: I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
ELAINE: So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
JERRY: It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
ELAINE: Yes, he is lazy.
JERRY: Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
ELAINE: Yes, he is dumb.
JERRY: So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
ELAINE: Dumb and lazy, I understand.
GEORGE: Tell you how you could check.
ELAINE: How?
GEORGE: Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
JERRY: No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
GEORGE: No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
JERRY: Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
GEORGE: Well that's the gist of it!
ELAINE: Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
JERRY: Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
ELAINE: How long have you two been together?
JERRY: I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
ELAINE & GEORGE: Nah.
(Jerry leaves to go meet Sophie by the register.)
GEORGE: By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
ELAINE: I needed to move a bureau.
[Kramer and Mickey enter Jerry's apartment.]
KRAMER: Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
MICKEY: Hey Jerry.
JERRY: Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
KRAMER: Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
MICKEY: Aah-choo.
KRAMER: A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
JERRY: What's with the fake sneezing?
KRAMER: Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
MICKEY: They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's an easy gig.
JERRY: Do medical schools actually do this?
KRAMER: Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
KRAMER & MICKEY: HUAAHHH!!
JERRY: I think the phone is ringing.
KRAMER & MICKEY: HUAAHHH!!
JERRY: Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
KRAMER: Mickey, DTs.
(Kramer and Mickey exit, shaking, while Jerry answers the phone.)
JERRY: Hello?
SOPHIE: Hey. It's me.
JERRY: Elaine?
SOPHIE: No, it's me.
JERRY: George??
SOPHIE: Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.
JERRY: Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: You got any Ipecac?
JERRY: Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
KRAMER: No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
JERRY: Did he overdose?
KRAMER: No, it's just too much.
[Office meeting at Kruger Industrial Smoothing.]
KRUGER: ...And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of a softball, and that spells trouble.
GEORGE: Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
(Everyone at the meeting breaks out in laughter.)
GEORGE: (getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
[Mt. Sanai Hospital, a woman in a lab coat is handing out envelopes to a group of people, Mickey and Kramer included.]
DR. WEXLER: In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.
MICKEY: Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!
KRAMER: Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
MICKEY: Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea, delusions, it's got everything.
KRAMER (to the man beside him) Howbout you, do you wanna trade?
MAN: Sure.
KRAMER: Okay, what do you got?
MAN: The surgeon left a sponge inside me.
KRAMER: Good luck with that.
[George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
JERRY: What did you do the rest of the day?
GEORGE: I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
JERRY: And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
(Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Hello boys.
GEORGE: Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
ELAINE: I did.
GEORGE: And the Christian rock?
ELAINE: Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
GEORGE: Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
JERRY: No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
ELAINE: Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
GEORGE: I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
JERRY: I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
ELAINE: "It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
JERRY: I thought so.
ELAINE: Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
GEORGE: I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Well, I got gonorrhea.
ELAINE: That seems about right.
KRAMER: That's what they gave me.
GEORGE: They? The Government?
JERRY: No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
KRAMER: And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
GEORGE: I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
(The other three start laughing.)
GEORGE: (leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
ELAINE: What was that?
JERRY: Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
KRAMER: See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
JERRY: Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
KRAMER: Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
[Mt. Sanai Hospital. Kramer is on the table surrounded by med students.]
STUDENT #1: And are you experiencing any discomfort?
KRAMER: Just a little burning during urination.
STUDENT #1: Okay, any other pain?
KRAMER: The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
STUDENT #1: Gonorrhea?!
KRAMER: Gonorrhea!
(The lab breaks out in spontaneous applause as Mickey turns up the lights and Kramer takes a bow.)
[Jerry and George are back at Jerry's apartment. Jerry is checking his phone messages.]
JERRY: One message. Hope it's not from you.
ANSWERING MACHINE: "Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back."
JERRY: Sophie.
GEORGE: She's still doing that?
JERRY: Yep.
GEORGE: Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
JERRY: I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
GEORGE: What the hell is a gander, anyway?
JERRY: (picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
SOPHIE: Hey Raef.
JERRY: (to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
GEORGE: Good, let her think it.
JERRY: (into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
SOPHIE: Not a lot.
GEORGE: Ask about you, ask about you.
JERRY: So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
SOPHIE: Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor story.
JERRY: Right, right, the tractor story.
SOPHIE: Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.
JERRY: I sound funny?
GEORGE: Abort! Abort!
JERRY: Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
GEORGE: That was very real.
JERRY: She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
GEORGE: Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
JERRY: Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
[Elaine and Puddy are at Puddy's apartment.]
ELAINE: So where do you wanna eat?
PUDDY: Feels like an Arby's night.
ELAINE: Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
PUDDY: Yes.
ELAINE: Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
PUDDY: That's right.
ELAINE: So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
PUDDY: Not for me.
ELAINE: Why not?
PUDDY: I'm not the one going to hell.
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.]
GEORGE: You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
JERRY: No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
GEORGE: Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
JERRY: No, she looks completely normal.
GEORGE: Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
JERRY: You think she's got toes for thumbs?
GEORGE: How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: Hands a little smelly?
JERRY: Why do I seek your counsel?
(Elaine walks in.)
ELAINE: Well I'm going to hell.
JERRY: That seems about right.
ELAINE: According to Puddy.
JERRY: Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
ELAINE: I'm not in the mood.
GEORGE: (To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
JERRY: What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
ELAINE: I know, but he does.
JERRY: So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
ELAINE: Well, relationships are very important to me.
JERRY: Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
GEORGE: (to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
[Kruger's office. George enters, seeing nobody but Mr. Kruger.]
GEORGE: Hey. Where is everyone?
KRUGER: They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my main man.
GEORGE: I am?
KRUGER: I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.
GEORGE: This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
KRUGER: Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.
GEORGE: Okay.
KRUGER: George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair) Three times around, no feet.
GEORGE: And?
KRUGER: All me.
[Kramer and Mickey are back at Mt. Sinai.]
DR. WEXLER: Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr. Kramer, you were excellent.
KRAMER: Oh, thank you.
MICKEY: Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! What did you get?
KRAMER: Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
DR. WEXLER: Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it.
KRAMER: I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
[Jerry and Sophie are at Jerry's playing chess.]
SOPHIE: I move my knight... here. Check.
JERRY: They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
SOPHIE: Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?
JERRY: Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
SOPHIE: Bought the farm?
JERRY: Tractor!
SOPHIE: This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.
JERRY: Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
(Sophie drops her purse and when she bends down to pick it up, Jerry nods knowingly.)
[Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.]
GEORGE: A scar?
JERRY: A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
GEORGE: A tractor.
JERRY: I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
GEORGE: I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
JERRY: She doesn't have toe thumbs.
GEORGE: Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
JERRY: Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
GEORGE: Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
KRUGER: I'm not too worried about it.
GEORGE: Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
KRUGER: Alright, alright I'm going.
GEORGE: (to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
JERRY: Never.
[Elaine's hallway. The door opens, Puddy steps out in his bathrobe. There's a newspaper in front of the door across from Elaine's.]
PUDDY: Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just grab that one.
ELAINE: 'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
PUDDY: C'mon, get it.
ELAINE: Well if you want it, you get it.
PUDDY: Sorry, thou shalt not steal.
ELAINE: Oh, but it's ok for me?
PUDDY: What do you care, you know where you're going.
ELAINE: Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
PUDDY: Nah.
ELAINE: C'mon.
PUDDY: Alright, what did I do?
ELAINE: David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
PUDDY: Gonna be rough.
ELAINE: Uh, you should be trying to save me!
PUDDY: Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.
ELAINE: I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
PUDDY: You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
ELAINE: Yeah, that's right!
(Elaine places her hands beside her head, index fingers raised as 'horns' and she emits a gutteral growling sound.)
[Mt Sanai Hospital. The actors are gathered. Mickey is practicing his part.]
MICKEY: Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for love in a bottle?
DR. WEXLER: Mr. Kramer? You're up.
(Kramer walks in, his face is noticably yellow.)
MICKEY: Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
KRAMER: Well, we'll see.
STUDENT #2: So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?
KRAMER: (pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
MICKEY: Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
(They fall to the floor, wrestling.)
STUDENT #2: Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?
[Elaine and Puddy have gone to see a priest, Father Curtis.]
FATHER CURTIS: Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.
ELAINE & PUDDY: Yeah, that's right.
FATHER CURTIS: Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--
ELAINE (Interrupting) Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here.
FATHER CURTIS: You aren't?
PUDDY: No.
ELAINE: We're just, you know, having a good time.
FATHER CURTIS: Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.
PUDDY: No way, this is bogus, man!
ELAINE: Well, thank you father.
FATHER CURTIS: Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng to the devil by the coffee machine?
PUDDY: I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.
ELAINE: Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
(Elaine makes the same 'fingers up' devil gesture as she did in her apartment and Father Curtis joins in.)
[Jerry and Sophie ar at Jerry's apartment.]
SOPHIE: You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.
JERRY: Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
SOPHIE: How could you know?
JERRY: (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
(Kramer and Mickey barge in, they're in the middle of an argument.)
KRAMER: ...I didn't say that, no.
MICKEY: You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!
KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
JERRY: Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
KRAMER: Oh. Hello.
SOPHIE: No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.
KRAMER: (to Mickey) You know? She's right.
SOPHIE: Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a tractor.
JERRY: You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
KRAMER: You can't get it from that.
SOPHIE: But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.
JERRY: (walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
[Mr. Kruger and George are burning the midnight oil. George is working, Mr. Kruger is bouncing a ball against the wall and catching it. George is percolating.]
GEORGE: Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
KRUGER: You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.
GEORGE: No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
KRUGER: K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? K-uger! K-uger!
GEORGE: Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
KRUGER: (getting up to leave) Thank you George, you've been great. That's it for me.
GEORGE: Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
KRUGER: It's K-uger!
GEORGE: No! No!
KRUGER: Goodnight everybody!
[Setting: Bookstore]
(George and Jerry both enter a bookstore)
GEORGE: I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
JERRY: First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
(Kramer walks up to Jerry and George while leafing through a book)
KRAMER: Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
JERRY: (Sarcastic) You better hurry.
GEORGE: I'm gonna hit the head.
KRAMER: Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
(George is about to go into the bathroom. He grabs a book on his way in)
KRAMER: Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
JERRY: She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
KRAMER: (Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.
JERRY: (Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
KRAMER: Oh? Who's Leo?
JERRY: Uncle Leo.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
(Kramer and Jerry both watch Leo looking at the books on a shelf. Then, Leo takes a book and puts it under his coat)
JERRY: Did I just see that?!
KRAMER: (To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
[Setting: The Annual Peterman Party]
(Elaine is sitting alone at a table. Walter, a co-worker, comes up to her)
WALTER: (Joking around with her) So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year?
ELAINE: Maybe.. All over your face!
(A waiter serving food approaches Elaine)
WAITER: If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.
(Elaine is looking both angry and embarrassed. Scene cuts to Peterman giving a toast)
PETERMAN: My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
(Scene cuts back to Elaine's table. A fellow employee sits down at Elaine's table)
ZACH: Hi, I'm Zach.
ELAINE: Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
[Setting: Bookstore]
(George casually puts the large book he took into the bathroom with him on the shelf. A manager notices, and approaches him)
MANAGER: Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?
GEORGE: (Acting innocent) I'm all set.
MANAGER: (Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?
GEORGE: (Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
[Setting: The Coffee shop]
(George and Jerry are at Monk's Coffee shop)
GEORGE: They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
GEORGE: They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
JERRY: (Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
GEORGE: I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
JERRY: (Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
GEORGE: Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
GEORGE: (Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
(Elaine enters and sits down)
JERRY: Sleeping in the caragain?
ELAINE: Cocktail flu.
JERRY: (Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
GEORGE: You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
ELAINE: (Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
GEORGE: You went home with him?
ELAINE: Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
JERRY: (Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
ELAINE: (Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
JERRY: (Confused) What's your position?
ELAINE: I am an associate.
GEORGE: Hey, me too.
(A waitress, passing their table, speaks up)
WAITRESS: Yeah, me too.
ELAINE: Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
GEORGE: Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
ELAINE: (Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
JERRY: (Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
ELAINE: (Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry enters his apartment to find Newman and Kramer having a conference at his table)
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
KRAMER: (Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
NEWMAN: (Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.
KRAMER: Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
JERRY: (Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
KRAMER: Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
JERRY: (Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
NEWMAN: He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
JERRY: Yes, it can.
KRAMER: We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
NEWMAN: It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.
JERRY: So, who's gonna pull this thing?
(Kramer and Newman both look at eachother)
KRAMER: (To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
NEWMAN: Yeah, but I though-
KRAMER: (Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.
JERRY: (Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
KRAMER: (Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
NEWMAN: Can't we worry about them later?
KRAMER: (Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
NEWMAN: (Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..
KRAMER: They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
[Setting: The Coffee shop]
(Uncle Leo enters, and joins Jerry at his booth)
LEO: Jerry, hello! (Sits down)
JERRY: So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?
LEO: I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.
JERRY: (Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
LEO: What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.
JERRY: (Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
LEO: Why didn't ya say hello?
JERRY: Because you were too busy stealing a book.
LEO: (Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.
JERRY: (Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
LEO: Oh, they don't care. We all do it.
JERRY: Who, criminals?
LEO: Senior citizens. No big deal.
JERRY: You could get arrested.
LEO: Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me home?
JERRY: (Pleading) Leo..
LEO: Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.
JERRY: (Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
LEO: (Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
[Setting: Peterman office building hallway]
ELAINE: (Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
WALTER: Well..
ELAINE: "Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
(Elaine enters into the break room. There, she sees Zach making out with another co-worker)
ELAINE: (Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
WALTER: (Pointing at the closed door) Isn't that Zach?
ELAINE: Yeah.
WALTER: Aren't you upset?
ELAINE: (Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
[Setting: NYC street]
(Kramer and Newman are standing there with a rickshaw. Close by are three homeless guys in a line)
KRAMER: Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
(One of the 2 remaining homeless men drops a bottle)
HOMELESS MAN: The government!
KRAMER: (Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
(Kramer looks at the two confused guys) Or a shirt..
NEWMAN: Alright, who's first?
(The homeless man with a shirt raises his hand. Kramer pats him on the shoulder - dust flies into the air)
KRMAER: Hey.
NEWMAN: Name, please.
HOMELESS MAN: Rusty.
NEWMAN: (Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.
KRAMER: (To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
NEWMAN: (To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and go!
(Rusty takes off down the street with the rickshaw)
KRAMER: (Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
NEWMAN: (Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
(They both notice that Rusty is not stopping)
KRAMER: Hey, what's he doin'?
NEWMAN: I think he stealing our rickshaw!
KRAMER: Well, then, he's out!
(Newman stops his timer. The other homeless man is still standing in line - alone)
HOMELESS MAN 2: (Salutes Kramer) I'll take the job. Potato salad!"
[Setting: Bookstore]
(Jerry and George are at Brentano's. George is trying to return the book)
GEORGE: Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
CASHIER: (Puts the book's code into the computer) I'm sorry, we can't take this book back.
GEORGE: Why not?
CASHIER: It's been flagged.
GEORGE: (Confused) Flagged?
CASHIER: It's been in the bathroom.
GEORGE: It says that on the computer?
CASHIER: Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books.
GEORGE: (Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
(George storms out. Jerry is about to follow until he sees Leo stealing another book)
JERRY: (To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
GUARD: Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?
JERRY: (Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
GAURD: (Into his walkie-talkie) We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond.
JERRY: '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
GUARD: Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. (The Guard rushes tward Uncle Leo) Swarm! Swarm!
(Suddenly, Leo is surrounded by guards)
LEO: What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!
GUARD: You're under arrest.
JERRY: (To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
LEO: Jerry, you ratted me out?!
JERRY: (Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
LEO: Hello.
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry is on the phone with his parents)
JERRY: Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
HELEN: Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.
JERRY: (Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
MORTY: She's got priors.
JERRY: (Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
HELEN: It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.
MORTY: Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.
JERRY: (Confused) What does that mean?
HELEN: Nobody pays for everyting.
JERRY: (Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!
MORTY: Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.
JERRY: Mom, you too?
HELEN: Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
(Kramer and Newman both enter)
JERRY: Alright, I'll talk to you later.
KRAMER: (While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
JERRY: (Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
KRAMER: (To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
NEWMAN: We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
(Newman and Kramer both go to leave)
JERRY: To the Idiotmobile!
[Setting: The Coffee shop]
(Jerry and Elaine are sitting at a booth)
JERRY: So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
ELAINE: That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
JERRY: (Butting in) Tina Turner?
ELAINE: (Accepting) Alright.
(George enters with his large art book)
GEORGE: Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
JERRY: Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
GEORGE: I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
JERRY: (Stern on George) Not underpants.
ELAINE: Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
(Uncle Leo is at the front desk in Monks. He's paying for his check)
JERRY: (Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
LEO: (Bitter) Jerry.
JERRY: (Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
LEO: (Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!
JERRY: (Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
(Elaine has picked up George's book, and is now thumbing through it)
ELAINE: French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
GEORGE: Nothing.
ELAINE: How much do you want for it?
GEORGE: You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
(Jerry has given up on Leo, and now rejoins Elaine and George at the booth)
JERRY: Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
GEORGE: (Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
JERRY: (Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
ELAINE: (Confused) What is wrong with this book?
GEORGE: Simmer!
JERRY: That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
ELAINE: (Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
GEORGE: (The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
JERRY: I don't read in the bathroom.
GEORGE: Well, aren't you something?
[Setting: Elaine's office]
(Peterman walks in)
PETERMAN: Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.
ELAINE: (Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
PETERMAN: Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?
ELAINE: (Confused) Love newton?
PETERMAN: I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.
ELAINE: An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
PETERMAN: And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.
ELAINE: Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
PETERMAN: Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.
ELAINE: Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
PETERMAN: (Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst. Better bring a poncho.
[Setting: Jerry's bedroom]
(Jerry is tossing and turning in his bed. Voices are going through his head while he's trying to sleep)
HELEN: It was a crime of passion.
LEO: If anyone betrays me, I never forget.
HELEN: He won't last a day in prison.
(Now, Jerry has slipped into a dream. He visualizes Leo in prison *NOTE* The following scene of Leo in jail is a parody of the movie "Cape Fear")
LEO: (Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers his right hand, and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right, yelling out) Answer that damn phone!
(Scene cuts to Jerry, who is just now waking up to the phone's ringing. He answers it)
JERRY: Hello?
ELAINE: Hey, it's me.
JERRY: Uncle Leo?
ELAINE: (Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
JERRY: Nightmares. You?
ELAINE: My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
ZACH: (Yelling out from off-camera) I'm burning up! Elaine!
ELAINE: Eat your soup!
JERRY: You're not feeding him, are you?
ELAINE: Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
(Jerry hangs up, then tries to go back to sleep. Kramer walks in)
KRAMER: Hey, buddy.
JERRY: (Scared) Ah! Kramer!
KRAMER: I thought I heard you.
JERRY: Get out of here!
NEWMAN: (From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's bedroom) There you are.
JERRY: Will everybody please leave?!
NEWMAN: I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.
KRAMER: Our rickshaw?
NEWMAN: It's entirely possible.
JERRY: I want everyone out!
KRAMER: (Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
NEWMAN: (To Jerry) Good night.
JERRY: (Bitter) Good night, Newman.
[Setting: Park]
(Newman and Kramer both find the rickshaw and Rusty in the park)
NEWMAN: There it is!
KRAMER: Rusty!
RUSTY: Oh, there you are. Oh, do I get the job?
KRAMER: (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
NEWMAN: Uh..
KRAMER: What?
NEWMAN: You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.
KRAMER: Yes, that's true.
NEWMAN: So, which one of us is gonna pull?
KRAMER: Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
NEWMAN: (Realizing he won) Yeah.
KRAMER: Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
(Scene cuts to Newman riding in the rickshaw - Kramer pulling)
NEMWAN: Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling!
[Setting: A homeless charity center]
(Geroge is trying to give the book to the homeless. He comes across Rebecca DeMornay - the same woman who confronted Elaine about her muffin stumps in episode "The Muffin Tops")
REBECCA: (Gesturing tward the book) So, you want to donate this to charity?
GEORGE: Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
REBECCA: What's the value of the book?
GEORGE: Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
REBECCA: (Correcting. Stern) It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.
GEORGE: Oh.
REBECCA: (Opens the cover of the book) Oh, wait a second. (Certain) This book has been in the bathroom.
GEORGE: (Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
REBECCA: It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw!
GEORGE: (Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
REBECCA: Yeah, and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!
GEORGE: I could take it in merchandise..
REBECCA: (Threatening to hit him) Here I come..
(George grabs his book and runs for his life)
[Setting: Bookstore]
(Elaine and Jerry are both at the bookstore. Elaine is talking with the cashier while checking out a book)
ELAINE: So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
CASHIER: Yeah.
ELAINE: Great.
JERRY: (To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
ELAINE: Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
JERRY: Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
ELAIEN: Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho.
(She's through buying the book, and is ready to go)
ELAINE: (Leaving Jerry) See ya.
JERRY: (To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
[Setting: NYC Street]
(Newman is being pulled up a steep hill on the rickshaw by Kramer)
NEWMAN: Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!
KRAMER: (Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
NEWMAN: Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.
KRAMER: (Stretching) Oh..
(The rickshaw starts to roll back down the hill)
NEWMAN: (Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
(The rickshaw starts to rapidly go down the street. Kramer makes an attempt to chase it)
KRAMER: Woah! Wait!
NEWMAN: Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
(Scene cuts to Zach. he's walking out into the street)
ZACH: (Optimistic) Well, this is the first day of the rest of my life!
(Scene cuts back to Newman - still rolling down the hill)
NEWMAN: Waaaaahhhh!
(Zach and the rickshaw collide. From back up on top of the street, Kramer tries to separate himself from the accident. He starts walking, then running away from the crushed rickshaw)
[Setting: Bookstore]
(Jerry is in Brentano's - waiting for the manager. He sees George enter)
JERRY: George? What are you doin' here?
GEORGE: I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
JERRY: (Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
GEORGE: So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
JERRY: (Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
GEORGE: I'm goin' in!
(George walks off to steal one of the books. The manager walks up to Jerry)
MANAGER: Did you want to speak with the manager?
JERRY: Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
MANAGER: Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.
JERRY: (Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
MANAGER: That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.
JERRY: So it could be anyone?
MANAGER: I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
(Jerry turns to George. George has a huge bundle under his overcoat - and is trying to act innocent)
JERRY: That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
(George is instantly surrounded by guards)
GEORGE: No! Jerry!
[INT. J. PETERMAN LUNCHROOM - DAY]
(Elaine and several co-workers stand around a table which has a cake sitting on it.)
ALL (singing): Happy birthday to you.
WALTER: Thanks.
(Everyone claps.)
FEMALE WORKER: Elaine, cake?
ELAINE: Uh, no, thanks.
FEMALE WORKER: It's Walter's special day.
ELAINE: You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
(Elaine takes a piece of cake and makes her way to the door, but is stopped as a male worker carrying a cake enters.)
MALE WORKER: Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. We have to celebrate.
ELAINE: It's his birthday and it's his last day?
MALE WORKER: This is other-Walter, from returns.
(Other-Walter enters followed by more co-workers.)
OTHER-WALTER: Hey, what's going on here?
ALL: Surprise!
OTHER-WALTER: Oh guys.

ELAINE: All right, pile it on.
ALL (singing, competing): For he's a jolly good fellow...happy birthday to you...for he's a jolly good fellow...birthday to you...which nobody can deny...
(Elaine looks on frustrated.)
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(Jerry and Elaine stand in front of his stereo.)
JERRY: What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
ELAINE: It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
JERRY: Why aren't you there now?
ELAINE: I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
(They sit on the sofa.)
JERRY: You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
ELAINE: Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
JERRY: Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
ELAINE: Your old high school hangout? Why?
JERRY: They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
(Kramer barges through the door holding a roll of yellow police tape.)
KRAMER: Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
(Jerry walks towards the counter where Kramer has placed some of the tape.)
KRAMER: Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
JERRY: Where did you get this?
KRAMER: Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
JERRY: You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
KRAMER: They want to know why they never see you.
(Kramer ties a piece of tape around a banana.)
KRAMER: I'm gonna eat that later.
JERRY: So they just gave you this?
KRAMER: Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
KRAMER: Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
JERRY: How come I haven't read about this?
KRAMER: Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
ELAINE: Really? What're the other titles?
KRAMER: Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
JERRY: Son of dad?
KRAMER: Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
[INT. MARIO'S PIZZA - DAY]
GEORGE: Mario's Pizza.
(George and Jerry admire their former hang out. Mario, an elder man, stands behind the counter.)
GEORGE: Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
MARIO: No.
JERRY: We used to come in every day.
MARIO: So where ya been? We're tanking here.
GEORGE: We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
MARIO: Oh, thanks. That'll save us.
JERRY: All right, make it the large sodas.
(George and Jerry walk across the room.)
GEORGE: Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
(They walk over to watch a boy playing Frogger.)
JERRY: Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
GEORGE: Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
(The boy loses.)
BOY: Thanks a lot.
GEORGE: Ah, beat it, punk.
(The boy exits.)
JERRY: Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
GEORGE: Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
JERRY: I remember that night.
GEORGE: The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
MARIO: Here's your pizza pea brains.
JERRY: I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
GEORGE: Yeah.
[INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE - DAY]
(Elaine is sitting at her desk smelling a pen.)
ELAINE (thinking): This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?
(There's a knock on the door and several co-workers enter with a cake.)
ELAINE: What is this?
MALE WORKER: You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well cake.
FEMALE WORKER: It's carrot. It's good for you.
WORKERS (singing): Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--
ELAINE: Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
MALE WORKER: I think it's nice.
ELAINE: What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
(Another worker enters late.)
WORKER (singing): Get well, get well soon--
MALE WORKER: It's not happening.
(They all start to leave disappointed.)
BECKY: Can we still it eat?
[INT. MONK'S DINER - NIGHT]
(Jerry and Lisi sit at the usual booth.)
JERRY: I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
LISI: End under water?
JERRY: Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
LISI: So much more violent.
JERRY: Not as long.
LISI: Well, I should probably--
JERRY: Get going.
LISI: Yeah.
(They both stand.)
JERRY: Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
LISI: Eight tomorrow?
JERRY: Actually, that's--
LISI: What you were thinking.
JERRY: Right.
(Lisi leaves and Jerry goes to pay the cashier. George enters.)
GEORGE: Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
JERRY: Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
(They both sit down at their booth.)
GEORGE: Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
JERRY: Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
GEORGE: So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
JERRY: Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
GEORGE: You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
(George gets up and leaves in a huff.)
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
KRAMER: Well, more bad news Jerry.
(Kramer and Jerry are talking near the kitchen counter. George is sitting at the table on Jerry's cordless phone. An open phone book is in front of him.)
KRAMER: You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
JERRY: Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
KRAMER: Not as many as there used to be.
GEORGE: No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
(Kramer peels and eats an orange.)
KRAMER: You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
JERRY: Another friend?
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
GEORGE: Well, is he good, Kramer?
(George gets up and walks towards Kramer.)
KRAMER: Oh, he's the best...and the worst.
GEORGE: Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
KRAMER: Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
GEORGE: Slippery Pete?
KRAMER: Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
GEORGE: All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
(George grabs his coat and leaves the apartment. The phone rings. Jerry tries to get by Kramer.)
JERRY: Come on.
KRAMER: Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
(Jerry picks up the phone.)
JERRY: Hello?
[INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE/JERRY'S APARTMENT]
(Elaine is on the phone and is smelling her tape dispenser.)
ELAINE: So how's it going with my friend?
JERRY: She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
(People can be heard singing "Happy Birthday" in the background of Elaine's office.)
JERRY: What is that?
ELAINE: Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.
JERRY: So join in.
ELAINE: I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
JERRY: All right.
(Jerry hangs up and stands up to find some police tape around a broken egg on the floor.)
JERRY: Hey, wh-what--
KRAMER: Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
(Kramer leaves.)
[INT. J. PETERMAN'S OFFICE - DAY]
(Elaine knocks on the open door.)
ELAINE: Anybody here? Peterboy?
(No one answers. She runs over to Peterman's fridge, opens it, and takes out a box. She opens the box to find a cake.)
ELAINE: Ooh, it's a cake walk.
(She takes a bite of the cake. Outside in the hallway, Mr. Peterman can be heard singing.)
PETERMAN (singing): Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
(Elaine quickly puts the box back in the fridge. Mr. Peterman enters his office.)
PETERMAN: Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, um--
PETERMAN: We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?
ELAINE: No, sir, I can't.
PETERMAN: Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000.
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT]
(Jerry and Lisi walk along.)
JERRY: Well Lisi, that was another-
LISI: Lovely evening.
JERRY: Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
LISI: Go for a hansom cab ride?
JERRY: Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
LISI: 84th street, right off Riverside Park.
JERRY: Riverside Park.
(Jerry grabs Lisi and turns around.)
LISI: I thought we were going--
JERRY: Back to my place. That's right.
[EXT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(George and Jerry are sitting on the sofa.)
GEORGE: So you slept with her?
JERRY: She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
GEORGE: And you automatically sleep with her?
JERRY: Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
GEORGE: Finished your thought.
(George gets up and walks over to the sink. Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: Guess what I ate.
GEORGE: An ostrich burger.
ELAINE: No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
JERRY: How'd it taste?
ELAINE: A little stale.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE (nudges Elaine with his elbow): So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?
ELAINE (nudges George with her elbow): No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.
GEORGE: You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
(Jerry and Elaine start to walk from the counter towards the table.)
ELAINE: Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
JERRY: Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
ELAINE: What is going on with you two?
JERRY: Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
GEORGE: What's that?
(Elaine opens up a paper bag and pulls out a cookie.)
ELAINE: 4:00 sugar fix.
JERRY: Well, I'm calling this off right now.
ELAINE: No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
JERRY: Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
ELAINE: Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
(Elaine bites the head of her gingerbread man.)
[INT. J. PETERMAN'S OFFICE - DAY]
ELAINE: Just a little off the side...
(Elaine is at Mr. Peterman's desk with the cake box.)
ELAINE: Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
(She eats a slice of the cake as fantasy waltz music starts to play. Elaine dances around the room talking to one of the sculptures in the room.)
ELAINE (thinking): Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?
(She gets more cake.)
[INT. MONK'S DINER - DAY]
GEORGE: Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
(George, Kramer, Slippery Pete, and Shlomo sit at a booth.)
GEORGE: Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
SHLOMO: I don't know If I'm the best.
GEORGE: Oh...you're very good.
SHLOMO: Let's say "good."
GEORGE: Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
KRAMER: Lock and load.
SLIPPERY PETE: You think you can handle that, numb nuts?
KRAMER: All right, all right, come on, now.
SLIPPERY PETE: That was my mail-order bride.
KRAMER: Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
SLIPPERY PETE: It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.
KRAMER: You weren't even married yet.
GEORGE: All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
(George gets a napkin and starts to draw on it.)
GEORGE: Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
SHLOMO: So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?
GEORGE: What do you mean?
SLIPPERY PETE: We're stealing this thing, right?
GEORGE: No. I--I paid for it.
SLIPPERY PETE: I thought we were stealing it.
KRAMER: Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
GEORGE: We're not stealing it.
SHLOMO: I definitely thought we're stealing it.
GEORGE: All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
SLIPPERY PETE: Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can I at least steal a battery?
GEORGE: Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
SLIPPERY PETE: What's that?
GEORGE: The outlet?
SLIPPERY PETE: Mm-hmm.
GEORGE: That's where the electricity comes out.
SLIPPERT PETE: Oh, you mean the holes.
SHLOMO: Which one's the bathroom?
GEORGE: Uh, here.
SHLOMO: They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.
GEORGE: The Frogger is here.
KRAMER: George, I thought that was the door.
SLIPPERY PETE: Where are all the pizza ovens?
SHLOMO: I thought the bathroom was here.
[INT. MARIO'S PIZZA - DAY]
(George, Shlomo, Slippery Pete, and Kramer are sitting in the same places as they were in the booth at Monk's, but this time they are around a table at Mario's.)
GEORGE: All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
[INT. MONK'S DINER - DAY]
ELAINE: I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
(Elaine is sitting at the counter with a Sotheby's auction book open in front of her.)
ELAINE: Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
(The waitress leaves and Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
ELAINE: Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.
ELAINE: Do any of these look close?
KRAMER: No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
ELAINE: Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
KRAMER: Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
[INT. LISI'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(There's a knock at the door. Lisi opens it. It's Jerry holding a baseball bat.)
JERRY: Hi, Lisi.
LISI: Hi, honey. Is that a bat?
JERRY: Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
LISI: So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?
JERRY: Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
MONTAGE:
(Lisi is sitting at her couch while Jerry paces behind her.)
JERRY: Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
(Both Jerry and Lisi are on the couch. Jerry has his head in his hands.)
LISI: Then may I say something... without being interrupted?
(Lisi is in another room with the door closed. Jerry stands in the hallway and is talking to her through the door.)
JERRY: Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
(They are sitting on the couch again. Jerry nods at everything Lisi mumbles.)
LISI: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh...
(Now Jerry is sitting on the couch and Lisi is pacing behind him.)
LISI: Are you afraid to kiss me in public?
JERRY: Have we even been in public?
(Jerry is walking away from Lisi and she follows behind him.)
LISI: So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking. Well, go ahead, 'cause I'd really like to know.
(Lisi is crying and Jerry stands looking over her shoulder.)
JERRY: You are not dumb. Don't say that..
(They both sit around the coffee table eating beans.)
JERRY: These beans are pretty good.
LISI: 20 minutes.
(Now Jerry is in a room with the door shut. Lisi stands out in the hallway.)
JERRY: Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
(Jerry opens the door.)

(Lisi is on the couch with Kleenex and Jerry stands on the other side of the couch.)
LISI: Fine. So it's over.
JERRY: Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
LISI: 9:30.
JERRY: We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
LISI: Good-bye, Jerry.
JERRY: Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
LISI: Out!
[EXT. LISI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
(Jerry steps out of Lisi's building. He looks both ways cautiously before walking down the steps. Surprised, he sees a shadowy figure walking towards him holding something resembling a head in one hand and a knife in the other.)
JERRY: Lopper.
(He quickly runs back up to Lisi's building and yells into her intercom system.)
JERRY: Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
(She buzzes him up. Just as he walks into the building, we see the Lopper is actually Slippery Pete carrying a car battery by it's wires)

JERRY: Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
GEORGE: Where?
(Lisi exits the boutique wearing a Dutch bonnet.)
LISI: Look what I found. I got one for you, too.
(She puts a Dutch hat on Jerry head.)
JERRY: Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
LISI: Ha ha. Ok. I'll meet thee in front of your place, 15 minutes.
(Lisi leaves.)
JERRY: A long, long weekend.
GEORGE: I hear thee.
[INT. J. PETERMAN'S OFFICE - DAY]
(Elaine has finished replacing the cake. She throws the empty Entenmann's box away. She's about to leave, but Mr. Peterman enters with another man.)
PETERMAN: Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Irwin Lubeck.
ELAINE: Oh, hello.
LUBECK: Charmed.
(Mr. Peterman gets the cake out of the fridge.)
PETERMAN: All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family.
ELAINE: I guess I'll just--
PETERMAN: Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost appraiser of vintage pastry.
(Lubeck inspects the cake.)
PETERMAN: All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?
LUBECK: I'd say about 219.

(George and Jerry see Kramer, Shlomo, and Slippery Pete standing outside Mario's Pizza. Slippery Pete is playing Frogger.)
GEORGE: What are you guys doing?
SHLOMO: Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!
GEORGE: You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
SLIPPERY PETE: The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 3 minutes left.
GEORGE: Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
KRAMER: George, they closed up.
GEORGE: I need an outlet!
SLIPPERY PETE: A what?
GEORGE: Holes! I need holes!
KRAMER: The pharmacy's still open.
GEORGE: All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
(Shlomo and Slippery Pete go to the pharmacy.)
SLIPPERY PETE (to George): You owe me a quarter.
GEORGE (to Jerry): Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!
(Kramer ties the police tape to a tree and runs into traffic. He runs out of tape before he can get halfway.)
KRAMER: Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
JERRY: Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
GEORGE: Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
JERRY: By yourself?
GEORGE: Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
(George pushes the machine onto the street. From a view in the sky, we see him dodging cars, hopping back and forth into lanes of traffic. Frogger music and sound effects play.)
SHLOMO: He looks like a Frog.
SLIPPERY PETE: So do you.
(George makes it across just as a huge truck comes barreling down the street. George tries to get the Frogger onto the sidewalk, but can't. He futilely sticks his hand out trying to stop the truck which honks. George jumps out of the truck's way and onto the sidewalk as the Frogger is smashed.)
JERRY: Game over.
[INT. J. PETERMAN'S OFFICE - DAY]
(Mr. Peterman sits in his chair behind his desk. Elaine knocks and enters.)
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
PETERMAN: Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the books--The Entenmann's shim-sham.
ELAINE: Ohh...
PETERMAN: Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it also caught this.
(Mr. Peterman shows Elaine the tape of her waltzing around the room eating the cake.)
EALINE: Mr. Peterman, I, uh...
PETERMAN: Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with you?
ELAINE: Um...as far as I know.
PETERMAN: Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?
ELAINE: Uh, I guess I hadn't--
PETERMAN: Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go through is punishment enough. Dismissed.
[INT. MONK'S RESTAURANT - DAY]
(George and Jerry sit at their usual booth.)
JERRY (to waitress): Cup of tea with lemon.
GEORGE: What happened to your voice?
JERRY: I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
GEORGE: Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
JERRY: Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
GEORGE: The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
JERRY: You mean like...Liza!
GEORGE: But I was thinking...T-bone.
JERRY: But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
GEORGE: There's no G-bone.
JERRY: There's a g-spot.
GEORGE: That's a myth.
(George takes a bite of his sandwich and gets a piece stuck to his chin.)
JERRY: T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(Jerry and Elaine are sitting on the sofa chewing gum.)
ELAINE: Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
JERRY: They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
ELAINE: Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
JERRY: Oh, I had that comin' to me.
ELAINE: You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
(Jerry's maid exits from his bedroom and walks over to the kitchen.)
ELAINE (whispering): Why did you get a maid?
JERRY: You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
ELAINE: Where did you get her?
JERRY: I hired her from a service!
MAID: All done.
JERRY: Thank you. Nice job.
MAID: Is this mine?
JERRY: Yeah.
(The maid leaves Jerry's apartment. Elaine smiles at Jerry.)
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
JERRY: Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
ELAINE: Oh.
JERRY: She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
ELAINE: Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
JERRY: You have a girlfriend?
(Jerry stands up; Kramer opens the fridge.)
KRAMER: Jerry, where have you been?
JERRY: At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
KRAMER: Downtown.
ELAINE: Downtown New York?
KRAMER: Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
JERRY: It's like 10 minutes by subway.
KRAMER: I don't know.
(Kramer opens a bottled carbonated drink which overflows and spills onto the floor.)
KRAMER: Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
ELAINE: What? What is that?
JERRY: That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
ELAINE: I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
KRAMER: Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
ELAINE: At work?
KRAMER: No. At your apartment.
ELAINE: I don't have a fax machine.
JERRY: Here we go.
KRAMER: Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
JERRY: And a dead bolt.
KRAMER (to Elaine) Are ya sure you don't have one? Because there's a lot of stuff in my apartment I've never seen.
ELAINE: Then maybe you have a fax machine.
KRAMER: You just blew my mind.
[INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY]
(Everyone is gathered around a large conference table.)
KRUGER: Let's order lunch.
KRUGER: Mary, I will have a chef's salad.
MALE WORKER: Turkey sandwich.
GEORGE: T-bone steak.
KRUGER: For lunch?
GEORGE: Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
WATKINS: That sounds good. I'll have one, too.
KRUGER: Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?
WATKINS: I love 'em.
KRUGER: Well, then we should call you T-bone.
GEORGE: Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
KRUGER: T-bone!
ALL (chanting): T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone!
[INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(The phone rings. Elaine enters her apartment carrying bags of groceries. She drops the bags and picks up the phone.)
ELAINE: Hello?
(A fax squeal.)
ELAINE: What?
(She checks her answering machine.)
MACHINE: You have 57 messages. Message one...
(Fax squeal. She skips to the next message.)
MACHINE: Message two...
(Fax squeal. She skips to the next message.)
MACHINE: Message three...
GEORGE: Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
(She skips to the next message.)
MACHINE: Message four...

EALINE: Hello?
(Another fax squeal.)
ELAINE: Aah!
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
JERRY: Well Cindy, the place looks great.
(She grabs her money off the counter.)
CINDY: Thanks Jerry, gotta run.
JERRY: Ok, I'll see ya.
(As Cindy leaves, Jerry gives her a big kiss. Elaine shows up and watches, amused.)
CINDY: Hi, Elaine.
(Jerry groans as Elaine enters and Cindy exits.)
ELAINE: All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
JERRY: Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
ELAINE: You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
JERRY: No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
ELAINE: What? A health plan?
JERRY: I was going to say, "Being a good host."
ELAINE: Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
JERRY: But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
ELAINE: So you consider this a relationship?
JERRY: Yes, I do.
ELAINE: Oh. Have you been out?
JERRY: Yes, we have.
ELAINE: Where did you go?
JERRY: The store.
ELAINE: Mm! To get what?
JERRY: Stuff.
ELAINE: Cleaning supplies?
JERRY: And gum.
ELAINE: Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
JERRY: She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
(Kramer sits down on the couch.)
ELAINE: Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
KRAMER: Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
ELAINE: Which ones?
KRAMER: Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
ELAINE: So this is never gonna stop?
KRAMER: Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
ELAINE: You can pick 'em up right now.
(Elaine imitates the fax squeal right into Kramer's ear.)
KRAMER: Ah!
[INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(She fondles a candle stick as a phone man fixes her phone.)
ELAINE (thinking): I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just disappeared...would anybody notice?
PHONE MAN: All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new number.
ELAINE: Ahem. 646? What is this?
PHONE MAN: That's your new area code.
ELAINE: I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
PHONE MAN: This is a new number.
ELAINE: No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
PHONE MAN: Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze of circular logic.
ELAINE: You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
PHONE MAN: I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
JERRY: Kramer, you're still on the phone?
(Kramer is sitting on the couch with a blanket. He's on the phone.)
KRAMER: Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
JERRY: Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
KRAMER (into phone): Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too.
(Kramer gets up and Jerry grabs the phone from him.)
JERRY: Madeline stays here.
(George enters.)
JERRY: Hey, T-bone!
GEORGE: No. No T-bone.
JERRY: No T-bone?
KRAMER (from bathroom): Hey, is that T-bone?!
JERRY: No! There's no T-bone!
KRAMER: Well, why no T-bone?!
JERRY: Why no T-bone?
GEORGE: 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
(Kramer returns from the bathroom and picks up the phone.)
KRAMER: Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
(Kramer opens the door.)
KRAMER: Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
(Kramer leaves.)
GEORGE: Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
KRAMER (from hallway): He's sleeping with his maid!
GEORGE: You're sleepin' with the maid?
JERRY: Yes.
GEORGE: I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
JERRY: No.
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY]
(Elaine and a man are talking.)
MAN: You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give out her number.
ELAINE: No, I'm not. Here you go.
MAN: 646?
ELAINE: It's a new area code.
MAN: What area? New Jersey?
ELAINE: No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
MAN: Do I have to dial a one first?
(Elaine nods and the man crumples up her number.)
MAN: I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
ELAINE: Yeah? Well, so am I!
[INT. KRUGER'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY]
GEORGE: Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
(George and Watkins stand just outside the conference room talking.)
WATKINS: It's T-bone.
GEORGE: The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
WATKINS: Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
GEORGE: What? Now, you listen to me!
(Kruger and a few other people watch George through the window of the conference room door.)
KRUGER: Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of that monkey that could read sign language?
WATKINS: All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying.
GEORGE (sniffling): I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that about your wife. Please accept my apologies.
(Watkins and George enter the conference room.)
GEORGE: Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
KRUGER: Koko the monkey.
GEORGE: What?
ALL (chanting): Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko!
[INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(Elaine walks down the hallway. Two people exit an apartment.)
MAN: Thank you both for being here.
EALINE: Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?
MAN: She passed.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm so sorry.
MAN: Thank you.
ELAINE: A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
CINDY: I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is.
(Cindy walks into Jerry's bedroom. Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?
JERRY: Yeah. It's in your closet.
KRAMER: No, no, no. I looked.
JERRY: They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
KRAMER: Thanks, buddy.
JERRY: Where you goin'?
KRAMER: Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
JERRY: Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
KRAMER: Oh.
(Cindy comes from Jerry's bedroom.)
CINDY: Hi, Kramer.
(She picks up her money from the counter.)
CINDY: Thanks, Jerry. Bye.
(She leaves.)
KRAMER: Well, what's the matter?
JERRY: What did I just pay for?
KRAMER: Uh-oh. You're a john.
[INT. MONK'S RESTAURANT - DAY]
JERRY: Koko?
(George and Jerry are sitting at the counter.)
GEORGE: Koko.
JERRY: Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
GEORGE: Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
JERRY: Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
GEORGE: Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
JERRY: No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
GEORGE: How much you pay this maid?
JERRY: 40.
GEORGE: 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
JERRY: I don't know what this is.
(Kramer enters and sits at the counter so George is between him and Jerry.)
KRAMER: Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
(Kramer shows of his I Love New York shirt.)
JERRY: Ooh.
KRAMER: Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
GEORGE: I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
KRAMER: Well, now I can't see Jerry.
JERRY: I look about the same.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: I was talking to him.
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: Never mind.
KRAMER: Come on. What'd he say?
GEORGE: Never mind.
KRAMER: Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
(Kramer and Jerry try to talk to each other by leaning back and forth, but keep missing each other. Jerry leans forward to look at Kramer, but Kramer leans back. Kramer leans forward, Jerry leans back.)
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Come on. Where'd you go?
JERRY: Go back.
KRAMER: Eh! Come on. What did you say?
JERRY: I said, never mind.
KRAMER: Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.
JERRY: I hate the counter.
(Elaine enters and sits at the counter next to Jerry.)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
ELAINE: I hate the counter.
KRAMER: Who's that?
ELAINE (to Jerry): Well, I got a 212 number from this little old lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz.
JERRY: Oh, she didn't mind?
ELAINE: No. She died.
JERRY: Hey, that's great.
GEORGE: What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
JERRY: Elaine got a new number because she died.
KRAMER: Newman died?
ELAINE: What did he say?
JERRY: Some new kind of pie.
GEORGE: I'll try a piece.
KRAMER: All right, who's down there?
JERRY: Hey, there's a booth.
(They all get up to move.)
KRAMER: Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE: Oh, hi.
KRAMER: Did you hear about Newman?
ELAINE: What?
(Kramer whimpers.)
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(Jerry is cleaning his kitchen and Cindy is reclined on the sofa. George enters.)
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah.
(He unfurls a jersey that reads, "Koko 00.")
JERRY: Double zero?
GEORGE: It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
CINDY: Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid service is named Coco.
GEORGE: Really? Coco?
CINDY: Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
(Cindy gets up and goes into Jerry's bedroom.)
GEORGE: You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
JERRY: Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
GEORGE: Say good-bye to Koko.
(George leaves as Kramer enters.)
JERRY: Good-bye, Koko.
KRAMER: Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
JERRY: Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
(Kramer storms out of the apartment and Cindy returns.)
CINDY: What was that?
JERRY: I didn't hear anything.
CINDY: All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?
JERRY: Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
CINDY: No. My money.
JERRY: For what?
CINDY: For my maid services. You booked me for today.
JERRY: But you didn't really do any work.
CINDY: I made the bed.
JERRY: But you took a nap in it.
CINDY: So?
JERRY: I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
CINDY: No. That was the maid.
JERRY: Well, who took the nap?
CINDY: The girlfriend.
JERRY: $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
CINDY: So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind of a prostitute?
JERRY: Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
CINDY: You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or your maid.
JERRY: So is this a breakup/quitting?
CINDY: Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
(Cindy walks out of Jerry's apartment.)
JERRY: Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
[INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - DAY]
PHONE MAN: Sign here.
ELAINE: Yes! 212.
(Elaine and the phone man.)
ELAINE: Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
PHONE MAN: Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job and never came back. Nobody knows what happened.
(The phone man leaves and the phone rings.)
ELAINE: All right! I am back in the game.
(She picks up the phone.)
ELAINE: Hello?
BOY: Gammy!
ELAINE: No. You got the wrong number, kid.
BOY: Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?
ELAINE: Oh...nuts.
BOY: Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
ELAINE: No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
(Elaine and Jerry are playing Battleship.)
JERRY: So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
ELAINE: Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
JERRY: Miss.
ELAINE: He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
ELAINE: Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
JERRY: Elaine...
(Elaine makes an explosion sound. Jerry nods in approval. The phone rings and Jerry answers.)
[JERRY'S APARTMENT/PHONE BOOTH]
JERRY: Hello?
COMPUTER VOICE: You have a collect call from--
KRAMER: Hey, buddy, don't say no!
JERRY: I accept.
KRAMER: I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
JERRY: Well, what happened?
(Elaine gets up and leaves.)
KRAMER: I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
JERRY: What's around you?
KRAMER: I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
JERRY: Is it Famous Ray's?
KRAMER: No. It's Original Ray's.
JERRY: Famous Original Ray's?
KRAMER: It's just Original, Jerry!
JERRY: Well, what street are you on?
KRAMER: Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
JERRY: Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
KRAMER: Aah!
(Jerry leaves.)
[EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT]
(Jerry finds a man waiting by his car.)
MAN: You Steinfeld?
JERRY: Yeah.
MAN: My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I sent one of my girls over to your place.
JERRY: Cindy.
MAN: She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay.
JERRY: You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
MAN: Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--
JERRY: Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
MAN: You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
JERRY: What?
MAN: Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her.
JERRY: I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
MAN: Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent contractor. Tax purposes.
[INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
(Elaine is sitting on her couch flipping through a magazine. She's on the phone.)
ELAINE: Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.

BOBBY: 9-1-1.

CINDY: I don't want any money from you.
JERRY: Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.

JERRY: Well, this is all very sophisticated.
[INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]

(Kramer is waiting near a phone booth with a suitcase. A car pulls up. It's Maxwell.)
MAXWELL: Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?
KRAMER: Uh, no.
MAXWELL: You know where you're going?
KRAMER: Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
MAXWELL: Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?
KRAMER: Uh, no.
MAXWELL: You wanna make some?
KRAMER: Ok.
MAXWELL: Do you know how to use a mop wringer?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

GEORGE: This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
KRUGER: So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, to hire people?
GEORGE: Yes?
KRUGER: Ok, good enough for me, Koko.
(George sits down.)
KRUGER: Ahem. Now, what's your name?
COCO: My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.
GEORGE: Coco?
KRUGER: We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being George.
GEORGE: Well, it was a hell of a ride.
KRUGER: All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the front. How do we get it off?
COCO: When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to take a wet rag and in a circ--
GEORGE: Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
COCO: What did you say about my Gammy?
GEORGE: Forget Gammy.
KRUGER: Who's Gammy?
GEORGE: There's no Gammy.
KRUGER: Maybe there should be a Gammy.
GEORGE: Oh, no.
KRUGER: George.
ALL (chanting): Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy!
GEORGE: Gammy's gettin' upset!
[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]
(The gang drives along in Jerry's car with the top down. Elaine and Kramer sit in the back, George is shotgun, and Jerry behind the wheel.)
GEORGE: Man, I'm starving.
ELAINE: How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
GEORGE: Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
JERRY: Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
KRAMER: You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
JERRY: I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
ELAINE: Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
GEORGE: Those nachos are killing me.
ELAINE: I thought you were hungry.
GEORGE: It's complicated.
KRAMER: Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
JERRY: Keep your shirt on. I got it.
ELAINE: Watch out for that maroon Golf.
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
JERRY: Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
KRAMER: I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
(Jerry swerves into another lane. Lamar, the driver of the maroon Golf honks the horn.)
JERRY: Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
KRAMER: You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
ELAINE: Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
KRAMER: Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
ELAINE: Oh, all right.
KRAMER: Yeah.
(Elaine and Kramer get up to moon Lamar.)
[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]
GEORGE: So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. What's that called?
GEORGE: Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.
JERRY: How was it?
GEORGE: I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
JERRY: Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
GEORGE: Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
JERRY: Heh.
GEORGE: The place went nuts.
JERRY: Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
GEORGE: Yeah.
KRAMER: Why are we slowing down?
(Music plays in the background.)
JERRY: What is that music?
GEORGE: What's with all these flags?
JERRY: Oh, no.
ELAINE AND JERRY: It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
ELAINE: Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
(Kramer stands up on the back seat.)
KRAMER: All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
[STOCK FOOTAGE: Puerto Rican Day parade.]
[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]
(Kramer runs along the sidewalk and hops into the back seat of a black Saab.)
KRAMER: Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
(There is a Puerto Rican family in the car.)
PUERTO RICAN MAN: Well, it is our day.
KRAMER: Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
(Kramer hops out.)
[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]
(Still sitting stopped in traffic are Elaine, Jerry, and George. They are listening to the radio.)
RADIO: And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.
JERRY: See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
GEORGE: I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
ELAINE: I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
JERRY: I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
KRAMER: All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
JERRY: But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
GEORGE: Just inch over. You worm your way.
ELAINE: Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
KRAMER: You know, you should make yourself throw up.
ELAINE: Huh?
KRAMER: You know you're going to.
JERRY: All right, I'm worming.
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
JERRY: They're not letting me in.
GEORGE: My hand is out.
JERRY: Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
ELAINE: You sure you want his face?
KRAMER: No, no, no. It was María Conchita Alonso.
GEORGE: This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
JERRY: The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
GEORGE: Look at me! I am man! I am you!
(The man in the other car looks over at George. Elaine, sitting behind George, aids in the cause by pleading to the man by mouthing the words, "Hi, can we go in?")
GEORGE: All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
KRAMER: Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
JERRY: One more lane to go.
GEORGE: All right! We're here!
(Just as Jerry is about to enter the one-way street, Lamar and his maroon Golf cut him off.)
LAMAR: Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.
JERRY: Maroon Golf.
LAMAR: Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.
JERRY: Could you move your car back a little?
LAMAR: Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
ELAINE: All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
(Elaine pushes George's seat forward slamming his head onto the dashboard. She gets out.)
JERRY: You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
ELAINE: I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
KRAMER: Con dios? Well, that's rude.
JERRY: Can you believe her?
GEORGE: Yeah. I'll see you later.
JERRY: Where are you going?
GEORGE: The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
JERRY: You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
GEORGE: It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
JERRY: That's not what I do.
GEORGE: Isn't it?
JERRY: Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
(George leaves.)
KRAMER: You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
[STOCK FOOTAGE: Taxis stuck in traffic].
[INT. TAXI CAB - DAY]
(Elaine sits in the back.)
ELAINE: Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
(She moves so she can yell out the driver's open window.
ELAINE (yelling): Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
(She leans back.)
ELAINE: Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
CAB DRIVER: No, you can't.
ELAINE: Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
(She pays her fare and gets out.)
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS]
(She starts to walk. The cab starts to move.)
ELAINE: Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
(The cab stops and she gets back in.)
[INT. TAXI CAB - CONTINUOUS]
CAB DRIVER: Where to?
ELAINE: That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
(She pays and gets out again.)
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS]
(Again, the cab starts moving when she gets out.)
ELAINE: Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
(She starts to run after the taxi which starts to move faster.)
[INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY]
(George sits down next to two attractive women.)
GEORGE: Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
LADY 1: What is that dot?
LADY 2: Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers.
(A red laser moves around the movie screen. Everyone laughs as the dot rests on the breasts of the movie actress.)
[INT. MOVIE LOBBY - DAY]
(The laser pointer guy uses his laser to point at a box of Skittles and RC Cola.)
LASER GUY: Gimme a box of those and one of those.
GEORGE: Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
LASER GUY: The laser's not funny. I'm funny.
GEORGE: Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
LASER GUY: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]
(Kramer and Jerry sit listening to the radio.)
RADIO What a comeback for the New York Mets-- 6 runs in the bottom of the ninth.
JERRY: I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
LAMAR: This traffic's a killer, ain't it?
KRAMER: You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
JERRY: Walk away?
KRAMER: You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
JERRY: Isn't there a deductible?
KRAMER: All right, what is your deductible?
JERRY: I don't know.
KRAMER: Yes, because they've already deducted it.
JERRY: From what?
KRAMER: The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
JERRY: We're not leaving the car!
KRAMER: All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
JERRY: Absolutely not. He sped up.
RADIO: Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit.
JERRY: I'm ready to talk.
[INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY]
(George and the ladies are sitting in their seats.)
LADY 1: Hey! There's that laser guy again.
LADY 2: He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.
LADY 1: I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair.
LADY 2: Mmm, yeah.
(There's an explosion on the screen. The laser moves around the screen and everyone laughs.)
GEORGE: That's gotta hurt!
(Everyone stops laughing.)
GEORGE: It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
(George stands up.)
GEORGE: Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
(The laser guy points the laser at George's head.)
LADY 1: Look! It's on the bald guy.
LADY 2: I am so glad we came to this showing.
[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]
(Kramer is talking to Lamar while Jerry waits in his car. Kramer walks to Jerry.)
KRAMER: Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
JERRY: What's that?
KRAMER: You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
JERRY: Ok!
(Jerry puts both hands up over his head and does the "I'm Sorry" wave.)
LAMAR: Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
KRAMER: Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
(Kramer gets in the car. George shows up and climbs into the back seat.)
GEORGE: All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
JERRY: What's that on your forehead?
GEORGE: It's probably chocolate.
JERRY: Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
GEORGE: All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
JERRY: See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
LAMAR: What was that?
JERRY: I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
(As Jerry pulls into the one way street, a taxi comes down the street and blocks him in. In the taxi is Elaine.)
JERRY: Elaine?!
ELAINE: Jerry?!
LAMAR: Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?
[INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
(The apartment is empty.)
[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]
(Jerry stands in front of the one way street yelling at the cars.)
JERRY: So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
PUERTO RICAN MAN: Buenos dias, my friend.
JERRY: Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
[INT. TAXI CAB - DAY]
(Elaine sits frustrated in the cab.)
ELAINE: Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
TAXI DRIVER: Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college!
ELAINE: Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
(She pays the driver and gets out.)
[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]
(Elaine walks up to Jerry.)
ELAINE: Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
JERRY: Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
LAMAR: So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.
ELAINE: I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
JERRY: Elaine, he doesn't need-
LAMAR: Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
JERRY: 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
(Kramer and George walk along eating churros.)
KRAMER: Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
GEORGE: Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
ELAINE: All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
(Elaine leaves.)
GEORGE: This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
JERRY: I don't know.
GEORGE: I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
KRAMER: You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
(Kramer leaves.)
JERRY: Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
GEORGE: Oh, my god.
JERRY: Hey, there's the soda guy.
LAMAR: Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!
JERRY (exasperated): All right!
(George stands petrified.)
[EXT. BARRICADE - DAY]
(A police barricade set up on the parade route prevents a crowd of people from crossing. Elaine pushes her way through the crowd.)
OLDER MAN: Hey, hey, hey!
OLDER WOMAN: Wha--ow!
ELAINE: Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
OLDER MAN: Well, none of us can! We're trapped!
OLDER WOMAN: Ow!
ELAINE: Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
(Elaine picks up a nylon flap that covers the sides of some bleachers.)
OLDER MAN: Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
ELAINE: Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
OLDER WOMAN: Father?
PRIEST: None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something.
PREGNANT WOMAN: Oh, all right, all right!
(People start going under the bleachers.)
ELAINE: All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
BUSINESS MAN: But it's dark!
ELAINE: Get in there!
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY]
(Kramer looks for a bathroom. He sees a sign that reads, "Rest rooms are for patrons only." There's another sign that reads apartment for sale.)
[INT. APARTMENT - DAY]

KRAMER: Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
SALES WOMAN: Yes! Come in, come in.
KRAMER: Ok.
SALES WOMAN: I'm Christine Nyhart.
KRAMER: Oh. Delicious to meet you.

(Jerry stands next to his car with a drink.)
LAMAR: You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't.
JERRY (sarcastically): Ho ho!
(George returns wearing mirrored sunglasses.)
JERRY: What seems to be the problem, officer?
GEORGE: They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
JERRY: At me?
GEORGE: No.
JERRY: Oh. It's back.
GEORGE: Bring it on, baby
JERRY: What if it gets in the side?
GEORGE: The side?
JERRY: Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
(George rips off his glasses.)
GEORGE: All right!
JERRY: Oh. It's in your eye now.
(George runs off screaming. Kramer runs up to Jerry with a Puerto Rican flag draped around him.)
KRAMER: Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
JERRY: Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!

JERRY: Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
SALES WOMAN: Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--
JERRY: Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
SALES WOMAN: Well, it's--
JERRY: Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
SALES WOMAN: Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist.
JERRY: Not Pennypacker!
SALES WOMAN: You know him?
JERRY: I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
[INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY]
(George and Kramer sit in the car. George looks in the rear view mirror.)
GEORGE: Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
(George exits the car.)
[INT. BLEACHERS - DAY]
(Elaine and the group reach the end of the bleachers.)
ELAINE: We should be able to get across right through here!

BUSINESS MAN: You thought?! We're gonna die in the dark! I knew it! I knew it! We're gonna die!
ELAINE: Get a hold of yourself!

ELAINE: Oh, god! Let us out!
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY]
(George hides behind a van and sees a man with a pen. He sneaks up and grabs the pen and destroys it. He ends up with ink all over his hands.)
GEORGE: That wasn't a laser pen.

(The delivery man laughs.)
GEORGE: Oh, that's funny
DELIVERY MAN: No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever.
[EXT. CITY STREET - DAY]
(Kramer lights a cigar with a sparkler.)
KRAMER: Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
(He tosses the sparkler into the back seat of Jerry's car where it lands on the Puerto Rican flag.)
KRAMER: Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
(Lamar starts to laugh as he sees the smoke rise.)
KRAMER: See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
(Kramer smells the smoke, turns, and sees the fire.)
KRAMER: Ooh! !Dios mio!
(He grabs the flag, throws it onto the sidewalk and stops on it.)
MAN: Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
BOB: Who! Who is burning the flag?!
KRAMER: Oh, no.
BOB: Him?!
CEDRIC: That's not very nice.
KRAMER: It was an accident.
BOB: Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!
CEDRIC: Because it's Puerto Rican day.
BOB: Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?
KRAMER: Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
(Kramer runs off screaming. The others give chase.)
[INT. APARTMENT - DAY]
(The sales woman lets George in.)
SALES WOMAN: Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.
GEORGE: Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
SALES WOMAN: It's down the hall.
(George walks to the bathroom, but stops when he sees Jerry.)
JERRY: Oh, hello...
GEORGE: Art.
JERRY: Mr. Vandelay, of course.
SALES WOMAN: You two know each other?
(Kramer bursts through the door.)

KRAMER: The factory?
JERRY: The Saab factory?
KRAMER: Jerry, that's in Sweden.
(George turns on the TV as Jerry runs to the window just in time to see a mob attacking his car.)
JERRY: My car!
KRAMER: Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
GEORGE: Jerry, the Mets lost.
JERRY: I love a parade!
[EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT]
(Jerry's car is stuck in a stairwell outside a building. Kramer, George, and Jerry admire the mob's handiwork.)
GEORGE: How do you suppose they did that?
KRAMER: Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
JERRY: Well, what about my car?
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
(Elaine approaches the group. She is totally disheveled with popcorn in her hair and her clothing stained.)
JERRY: Hey, there's Elaine.
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
ELAINE: Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
(Lamar drives up in his maroon Golf.)
LAMAR: Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around!
(He drives off.)
JERRY: Well, at least he didn't-
LAMAR: Jackass!
(Jerry sets his car alarm.)
JERRY: Somebody remember where we parked.
KRAMER: This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
(The foursome walk off as a laser lights up George's rear end.)
[Opening Monologue]
It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don'tyou come in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then our brains will work.
[Jerry and George at Monks]
GEORGE: I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
JERRY: I know what you mean.
GEORGE: Do ya?
JERRY: It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
GEORGE: Same thing!
JERRY: Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
GEORGE: Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
WOMAN: What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
MAN: It's up to you.
WOMAN: You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
JERRY: So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
GEORGE: Nah - what for?
JERRY: To see a movie.
GEORGE: I've been to the movies.
JERRY: Not this movie.
GEORGE: They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
JERRY: Did you shower today?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
GEORGE: When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
JERRY: Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
GEORGE: Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
WOMAN: All right, we're done. You can have it now.
GEORGE: Oh, very gracious.
[Jerry and George are walking down the sidewalk. Kramer and Elaine drive up.]
MAN: Nice day
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: What is that?
KRAMER: Hey! JoJo!
JERRY: Ey, ey!
ELAINE: All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
KRAMER: No, thank you. So what are you doing?
JERRY: Nothing.
KRAMER: Come on, let's go to the beach.
GEORGE: What are you crazy?
KRAMER: What? It's a beautiful day.
JERRY: Have a good time.
KRAMER: Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
JERRY: You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
KRAMER: Yeah, there's something in the air.
(Kramer drives off)
ELAINE: Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
JERRY: Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
ELAINE: What? No good?
JERRY: Faux pas.
ELAINE: Faux pas?
GEORGE: Big hefty stinking faux pas.
ELAINE: Why?
JERRY: You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
GEORGE: On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
JERRY: It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
GEORGE: It's dismissive.
JERRY: It's pompous.
GEORGE: Why don't you think before you do something?
ELAINE: Here's a thought - Bye bye.
(Elaine leaves)
GEORGE: Too much?
[Jerry and George enter Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
JERRY: Hey - hey - hey!
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
GEORGE: You're so uptight.
JERRY: Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
[Jerry listens to his answering machine]
PHONE TAPE: Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks.
JERRY: Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
GEORGE: Who's he?
JERRY: He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
GEORGE: Our show, "Jerry"?
JERRY: Right.
GEORGE: "Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
JERRY: Yeah!
GEORGE: When?
JERRY: Today, like right now.
GEORGE: Right now? "Jerry"?
JERRY: "Jerry"!
GEORGE: He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
JERRY: He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
GEORGE: "Jerry"!
JERRY: "Jerry"!
GEORGE: Can I go like this?
JERRY: Sure!
GEORGE: No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
JERRY: Forget the sports jacket.
GEORGE: I won't feel like a writer.
JERRY: You're not a writer.
GEORGE: Right!
[Jerry and George are sitting in a waiting room at NBC]
GEORGE: Water. Need some water! Water here!
JERRY: Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
GEORGE: Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
JERRY: Don't blow this.
GEORGE: I will not blow this.
JERRY: If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
GEORGE: It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
JERRY: He might not want nothing.
GEORGE: Something, nothing, I could care less.
JERRY: He might want a show about anything and everything.
GEORGE: Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
JERRY: All right.
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you
GEORGE: Magic time.
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: nothing
[Jerry and George are escorted into Mr. Kimbrough's office]
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Kimbrough.
STU: Hey, Jerry, good to see you.
GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey!
STU: How you been?
JERRY: Good, good. You remember George.
STU: George, good to see you.
GEORGE: Hello Stu.
STU: You remember Jay Crespi.
GEORGE: Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
STU: This is James Kimbrough.
KIMBROUGH: Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in.
GEORGE: Kimbrough.
JERRY: Don't spell.
GEORGE: K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
KIMBROUGH: That's right.
GEORGE: It's a talent I have.
KIMBROUGH: Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.
GEORGE: Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
JERRY: Shut up, George.
KIMBROUGH: Can I get you anything?
GEORGE: What do we have in the fruit department?
JERRY: Oy.
STU: Pineapple.
GEORGE: Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
KIMBROUGH: Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.
GEORGE: Been there, done that.
KIMBROUGH: Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers.
GEORGE: Water coolers?
CRESPI: We call it a water-cooler show.
JERRY: Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
GEORGE: See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
JERRY: Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
GEORGE: It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
JERRY: But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
KIMBROUGH: Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, "Jerry", that he developed five years ago.
STU: I have always loved it.
KIMBROUGH: He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to tell you - I flipped out.
CRESPI: He totally flipped out.
KIMBROUGH: What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy.
JERRY: He's a little off the wall.
CRESPI: Oh yeah.
STU: Kramer.
KIMBROUGH: And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
JERRY: Definitely.
GEORGE: I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
KIMBROUGH: Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?
GEORGE: Or we could get them together. Woo!
[George and Jerry attempt a hug outside Mr. Kimbrough's office]
GEORGE: Yeah!
JERRY: Yeah!
[Elaine is at home using the phone when Jerry calls to tell her the news]
ELAINE: Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
JERRY: Hi. Elaine, it's me.
ELAINE: Jerry, I'm on the other line.
JERRY: No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
JERRY: The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
ELAINE: That's the emergency?
JERRY: Did you hear what I said?
ELAINE: I was on the other line talking to Jill.
JERRY: Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
ELAINE: You said it was an emergency.
JERRY: So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
[Jerry is telling his parents the good news about Jerry]
HELEN: Congratulations, they're doing the show.
MORTY: They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.
HELEN: She's not six-six.
MORTY: Jerry, you ever watch that?
JERRY: Yeah, it's pretty good.
[George is telling his parents the news.]
ESTELLE: They picked up the show?
GEORGE: I'm moving to California.
FRANK: Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.
ESTELLE: The NBC guy liked it?
GEORGE: Of course he liked it.
ESTELLE: He told you he liked it?
GEORGE: He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
ESTELLE: Well, what are you doing?
GEORGE: I'm writing.
ESTELLE: You know how to write?
FRANK: Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.
ESTELLE: Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
GEORGE: Ma?!
ESTELLE: I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas?
FRANK: Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
GEORGE: I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
ESTELLE: Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is on the phone with his agent, Kramer walks in.)
JERRY: NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
KRAMER: Oh hey!
JERRY: Hey - how was the beach?
KRAMER: Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
JERRY: I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
KRAMER: You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
JERRY: So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
KRAMER: You're moving to California?
JERRY: Yeah, only for a while.
KRAMER: Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
JERRY: No, I'll be back.
KRAMER: Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
JERRY: And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
KRAMER: Fling!
[The group is sitting at their table at Monks]
ELAINE: So we can go anywhere we want?
JERRY: Anywhere.
ELAINE: Why are they doing this?
JERRY: I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
ELAINE: This is all very exciting.
GEORGE: So? Where are we going?
KRAMER: I say Japan.
ELAINE: Why Japan?
KRAMER: Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
ELAINE: Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
JERRY: Russia, it's so bleak.
ELAINE: It's not bleak - it's springtime.
JERRY: It's still bleak.
ELAINE: You can't be bleak in spring.
JERRY: You can be bleak in spring.
GEORGE: If you're bleak, you're bleak.
ELAINE: What about Switzerland?
KRAMER: Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
GEORGE: It's a bit hilly - no?
ELAINE: You're not going to do any walking.
GEORGE: What if I want to walk around a little?
ELAINE: So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
GEORGE: What if I'm at the bottom?
ELAINE: All right! You know what, just forget it!
JERRY: Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
ELAINE: I'll go to Paris.
GEORGE: Me too.
KRAMER: Oh yeah - oui oui.
JERRY: So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
(they put theirs hands in the middle)
GROUP: Yeah!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
JERRY: Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
ELAINE: Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
JERRY: First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
ELAINE: All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
(Knock at the door. Jerry answers.)
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry.
JERRY: Hello, Newman. What gives?
NEWMAN: I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris?
JERRY: Yeah, that's right.
NEWMAN: Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I'm one-quarter French.
JERRY: Really.
NEWMAN: Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you, but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker.
JERRY: That's a shame.
NEWMAN: Take me! Take me!
JERRY: Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
NEWMAN: All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I'll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down.
[The group arrives by limo to the airport]
CAPTAIN: Ah, Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah.
CAPTAIN: I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?
JERRY: All set. We'll just grab the bags.
CAPTAIN: Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
JERRY: Just keeps on getting better and better.
(Our heroes enter the plane)
JERRY: Not bad.
ELAINE: Wow!
KRAMER: The only way to fly.
GEORGE: This is it?
(After take-off, the group chit-chats)
GEORGE: I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
JERRY: You're complaining about a private jet?
GEORGE: You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
JERRY: Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
GEORGE: Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
ELAINE: Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
GEORGE: This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
JERRY: You're not writing any letters!
ELAINE: Will you turn around?
GEORGE: Why?
ELAINE: You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
GEORGE: It's effeminate to sit like this?
ELAINE: Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
GEORGE: How is this effeminate?
ELAINE: I don't know - it just is.
GEORGE: Kramer, what are you doing?
JERRY: Still got water in your ear?
KRAMER: Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
GEORGE: Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
KRAMER: I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
GEORGE: Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
GEORGE: Kramer!
CAPTAIN: Hey, get the hell out of here!
ELAINE: What is that?
GEORGE: Oh my God!
ELAINE: What is that noise? What is that noise?
JERRY: Kramer, what the hell did you do?
KRAMER: I lost my balance.
ELAINE: Oh my God!
ELAINE: What's going on?
JERRY: Kramer!
KRAMER: It was an accident.
GEORGE: I told you to stop with the hopping.
ELAINE: Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
GEORGE: Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
JERRY: Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
KRAMER: I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
GEORGE: Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: There's something I have to tell you.
JERRY: What? What is it?
GEORGE: I cheated in the contest.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: The contest - I cheated.
JERRY: Why?
GEORGE: Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
JERRY: Great - I won.
ELAINE: Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
JERRY: Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
ELAINE: No no - me first.
JERRY: Alright.
ELAINE: Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
GEORGE: Hey - What's going on?
KRAMER: We're straightening out!
ELAINE: We're straightening out?
JERRY: We're straightening out!
GEORGE: We're straightening out!
GROUP: Yeah!
[Outside the plane]
CAPTAIN: Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.
JERRY: Where are we?
CAPTAIN: Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.
JERRY: Okay.
ELAINE: Okay.
JERRY: We'll see you later.
[In front of a store, in Latham, Massachusetts]
ELAINE: Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
JERRY: I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
GEORGE: I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
ELAINE: Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
GEORGE: First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
JERRY: Alright, I'll feel him out.
GEORGE: Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
STRANGER: Nice day.
JERRY: Another one?
(A carjacking takes place in front of the group)
ROBBER: Alright fatso, out of the car.
KRAMER: I want to capture this.
ROBBER: Come on! Gimme your wallet.
VOGEL: Don't shoot.
JERRY: Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
GEORGE: He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
ROBBER: I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.
JERRY: That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
VOGEL: Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!
JERRY: Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
KRAMER: All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
ELAINE: Forget it.
JERRY: No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
OFFICER: All right, hold it right there.
KRAMER: What?
OFFICER: You're under arrest.
JERRY: Under arrest? What for?
OFFICER: Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
ELAINE: What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
OFFICER: That's exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it's reasonable todo so.
GEORGE: I never heard of that.
OFFICER: It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
[In a cell, at the Latham County Jail]
ELAINE: The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
GEORGE: Why would we want to help somebody?
ELAINE: I know.
GEORGE: That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
KRAMER: The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
ELAINE: Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
DEPUTY: Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around.
JERRY: Oh, yeah.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah.
DEPUTY: You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.
GEORGE: All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
DEPUTY: Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison.
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
DEPUTY: California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.
[Lawyer Jackie Chiles' office]
CHILES: Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.
(The phone rings)
SECRETARY: Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
CHILES: You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away.
[Hoyt's Office]
HOYT: So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything.
[The four are in prison, having a meal]
KRAMER: Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
GEORGE: Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
ELAINE: I guess we could've called for help.
JERRY: But then we would have missed the whole thing.
KRAMER: I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
GEORGE: Yeah, he's right.
JERRY: I forgot about the video.
ELAINE: Sure - the video.
(Jerry's beeper starts beeping)
ELAINE: What is that?
JERRY: Plane's ready.
[Rivera Live news show]
RIVERA: Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-
WELLS: Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.
RIVERA: What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
WELLS: Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town.
RIVERA: And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up?
WELLS: Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote "There's no love lost with that group."
RIVERA: Anything else, Jane?
WELLS: There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it's possible that ended badly.
RIVERA: Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.
[Jerry's parents are packing]
HELEN: I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
MORTY: What's all that?
HELEN: Cereal.
MORTY: You're packing cereal?
HELEN: I'm bringing it for Jerry.
MORTY: You got enough here for a life sentence.
HELEN: He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
MORTY: So bring a snack-pack.
[George's parents are packing]
ESTELLE: Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault.
FRANK: Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
ESTELLE: Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours.
FRANK: You were the one who smothered him.
ESTELLE: I did not smother him.
FRANK: You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
ESTELLE: Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis.
FRANK: I had to make a living!
[Newman, laughing, leaves his building with a suitcase. Uncle Leo leaves with his bags, followed by J. Peterman, David Puddy in his 8-ball jacket, Mickey, Kenny Bania, Mr. and Mrs. Ross, Mr. Bookman, Keith Hernandez, and George Steinbrenner.]
[The four are at a table. Jerry and Kramer are enjoying some cereal, while they wait for Jackie Chiles.]
KRAMER: This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
JERRY: You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
KRAMER: I bet.
JERRY: It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
(Enter Jackie Chiles)
CHILES: Good morning.
ELAINE: Good morning, Jackie.
JERRY: Good morning.
CHILES: Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan?
GEORGE: It makes me look older.
CHILES: Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who's getting robbed.
(Jerry laughs)
CHILES: Do you think it's funny?
JERRY: No.
CHILES: You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase.
ELAINE: How do I look, Jackie?
CHILES: Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady.
ELAINE: Thank you, Jackie.
KRAMER: How bout me, Jackie?
CHILES: Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine. Jury's going to pick up on that.
(Jackie hands Jerry a tie)
CHILES: Here.
JERRY: This one?
CHILES: That's right.
JERRY: Do I have to?
ELAINE: Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
[Court is starting]
BAILIFF: All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding.
GEORGE: Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
CHILES: Vanda who?
GEORGE: Jerry, did you hear that?
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: I think that's a good sign.
VANDELAY: Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
HOYT: We are, Your Honor.
VANDELAY: Mr. Hoyt.
HOYT: Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay.
(Newman shown eating popcorn)
VANDELAY: Mr. Chiles.
CHILES: I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only you can stop them.
VANDELAY: Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
HOYT: We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand.
BAILIFF: Call Matt Vogel.
HOYT: So they were just standing there?
VOGEL: Yes.
HOYT: Did one of them have a video camera?
VOGEL: Yes.
HOYT: Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A.
VANDELAY: Proceed.
[The tape plays]
VOGEL: Don't shoot.
JERRY: Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
ELAINE: See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
GEORGE: He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
[New Witness: the victim of the robbery]
HOYT: So they just stood there and did nothing?
VOGEL: Yeah, nothing. Nothing!
HOYT: No further questions.
(Enter NBC executives Stu Chermak and Jay Crespi)
GEORGE: Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
HOYT: Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
BAILIFF: Call Mabel Choate.
CHILES: Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential.
HOYT: Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for years.
VANDELAY: Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
HOYT: Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th.
CHOATE: Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man.
HOYT: Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
HOYT: What did he want?
CHOATE: My marble rye.
HOYT: Your marble rye?
CHOATE: I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no.
HOYT: And then you left the bakery.
CHOATE: That's right.
HOYT: But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?
CHOATE: Oh no.
[Flash-back from past episode, "The Rye"]
JERRY: Gimme that rye.
CHOATE: Stop it.
JERRY: I want that rye lady.
CHOATE: Help - someone help.
JERRY: Shut up, you old bag!
[Back to the courtroom]
HOYT: No further questions.
HOYT: I call Marla Penny to the stand.
BAILIFF: Call Marla Penny.
JERRY: The virgin!
HOYT: And what was your connection to the defendants?
PENNY: I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
HOYT: Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened.
PENNY: It's rather difficult to talk about.
HOYT: It's alright. Take your time.
PENNY: Well, I became aware of a -
HOYT: A what?
PENNY: A, uh -
HOYT: Yes?
PENNY: A contest.
HOYT: Contest?
PENNY: Yes.
HOYT: What was the nature of the contest?
PENNY: Oh please, I can't.
HOYT: It's okay.
PENNY: The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
HOYT: Yes?
PENNY: To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
PETERMAN: For the love of God!
PENNY: It was horrible, horrible!
HOYT: Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
JERRY: Who the hell is that?
MR. SANGER: Come on Donald, you're doing fine.
GEORGE: The Bubble Boy!
CHILES: Bubble Boy?
JERRY: That's right, the Bubble Boy.
CHILES: What's a Bubble Boy?
JERRY: He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
BUBBLE BOY: What the hell are all you looking at?
HOYT: So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992.
BUBBLE BOY: Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit.
[Flash-back from past episode, "The Bubble Boy"]
GEORGE: Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
BUBBLE BOY: That's a joke - the Moors.
GEORGE: Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
BUBBLE BOY: Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a misprint.
GEORGE: Sorry, the card says Moops.
BUBBLE BOY: It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.
GEORGE: It's Moops.
BUBBLE BOY: Moors!
GEORGE: Moops!
GEORGE: Help! Someone!
BUBBLE BOY: There's no Moops, you idiot.
SUSAN: Stop it! Let go of him!
MRS. SANGER: Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it.
[Back to the court]
GEORGE: It was Moops.
BUBBLE BOY: Moors.
[New Witness: the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in "The Handicapped Spot"]
HOYT: So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?
LADY: That's right.
HOYT: And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
LADY: That's right.
[Flash-back showing lady screaming going out of control down hill in her wheelchair.]
[New Witness: Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died]
HOYT: So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
WILCOX: Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it.
HOYT: So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was?
WILCOX: I would describe it as restrained jubilation.
MR. ROSS: Murderer!
MRS. ROSS: He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
VANDELAY: Order in this court!
HOYT: Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
CHILES: Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?
HOYT: So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
SIDRA: Yes.
HOYT: And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
SIDRA: Yes, that's true.
HOYT: Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
SIDRA: We were in the sauna, making chit-chat.
[Flash-Back from past episode, "The Implant"]
SIDRA: You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie.
ELAINE: Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
[Back in the courtroom]
HOYT: So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?
SIDRA: Yes.
HOYT: Why would she do something like that?
SIDRA: Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
[New Witness: Joe Bookman, library cop]
HOYT: State your name.
BOOKMAN: Bookman, Joe Bookman.
HOYT: And what's your occupation?
BOOKMAN: I'm a library cop.
HOYT: What does a library cop do?
BOOKMAN: We chase down library delinquents.
HOYT: Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
BOOKMAN: Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld.
HOYT: How long was his book overdue?
BOOKMAN: 25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.
HOYT: What do you call them?
BOOKMAN: Criminals.
[New Witness: George's old girlfriend]
HOYT: So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
WOMAN: Yes.
HOYT: And then what happened?
WOMAN: Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -
[Flash-Back from past episode, "The Fire"]
GEORGE: Fire! Get out of the way!
[New Witness: parking lot security guard]
GUARD: At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.
[Flash-back from past episode, "The Parking Garage"]
JERRY: Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
GUARD: I don't know.
JERRY: Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
[Back to the courtroom]
HOYT: Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom!
CHILES: Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990.
VANDELAY: Sit down, Mr. Chiles.
[New Witness: Police Detective]
HOYT: Alright, Detective, then what happened?
DETECTIVE: We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot.
[Flash-Back from past episode, "The Wig Master"]
PROSTITUTE: You just cost me some money.
KRAMER: Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
POLICE: Police officers - freeze right there!
[Back to the courtroom]
HOYT: So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp.
(Detective shacks his head "yes")
[Witness: the low-talker from "The Puffy Shirt"]
HOYT: So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
LOW-TALKER: (Mumbles)
HOYT: Excuse me?
CHILES: Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman's a low-talker. I can't hear a word she's saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let's move on.
[New Witness: George Steinbrenner]
HOYT: Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
BAILIFF: Call George Steinbrenner.
HOYT: So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
STEINBRENNER: Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?
GEORGE: Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
STEINBRENNER: He had one little problem though.
HOYT: What was that?
STEINBRENNER: He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
FRANK: How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
VANDELAY: Order!
[New Witness: Marcellino from "The Little Jerry"]
HOYT: Cock fighting?
MARCELLINO: Cock fighting.
[New Witness: Pharmacist from "The Sponge"]
PHARMACIST: Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them.
[New Witness: Elaine's old boyfriend from work]
MAN: She exposed her nipple.
[New Witness: Mr. Pitt]
HOYT: How did she try to kill you?
PITT: She tried to smother me with a pillow.
HOYT: Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
BAILIFF: Call Yev Kassem.
JERRY: Who?
ELAINE: The Soup Nazi!
CHILES: Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.
HOYT: State your name.
SOUP NAZI: Yev Kassem.
HOYT: Could you spell that?
SOUP NAZI: No! Next question.
HOYT: How do you know the defendants?
SOUP NAZI: They used to come to my restaurant.
[Flash-Back to "The Soup Nazi" Episode]
GEORGE: Medium turkey chili.
JERRY: Medium crab bisque.
GEORGE: I didn't get any bread.
JERRY: Just forget it. Let it go.
GEORGE: Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
SOUP NAZI: You want bread?
GEORGE: Yes, please.
SOUP NAZI: Three dollars!
GEORGE: What?
SOUP NAZI: No soup for you!
[Back in the courtroom]
SOUP NAZI: But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back.
[Flash-Back to the "Soup Nazi" episode]
ELAINE: Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
SOUP NAZI: That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
ELAINE: You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
[Back in the courtroom]
SOUP NAZI: She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business!
ELAINE: Soup's not all that good anyway.
SOUP NAZI: What did you say?!
HOYT: The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
JERRY: How did they find Babu?
ELAINE: I thought he was deported.
HOYT: You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?
BABU Yes, all the way from Pakistan.
HOYT: And what's your connection to the defendant?
BABU I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But nobody came! There were no people.
HOYT: And then what happened?
BABU Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me, just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice. Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad! Very, very, very bad!
[Rivera Live]
RIVERA: Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane -
WELLS: Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.
RIVERA: That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery.
WELLS: Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.
RIVERA: Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?
WELLS: That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night.
RIVERA: And so we wait.
[The group, waiting for the jury to decide]
JERRY: Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
ELAINE: I think so.
JERRY: It's not that bright orange one is it?
ELAINE: I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
KRAMER: Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
[George's mother, Estelle, tries to butter up Judge Vandelay]
ESTELLE: Sorry to bother you, Judge.
VANDELAY: How did you get in here?
ESTELLE: Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.
VANDELAY: This is highly irregular.
ESTELLE: Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.
VANDELAY: What do you mean?
ESTELLE: You know
[Witnesses waiting in pool hall, at restaurant, etc. Mr. Ross buys a gun]
[Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles are in bed]
SIDRA: Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.
CHILES: We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.
(Phone rings)
CHILES: Hello? Damn. They're ready.
[Back in the courtroom]
JERRY: Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
ELAINE: I've always loved ... United Airlines.
(Jury reenters the courtroom)
KRAMER: I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
JERRY: Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
BAILIFF: All rise.
VANDELAY: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN: We have, Your Honor.
VANDELAY: Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference?
FOREMAN: We find the defendants - guilty.
VANDELAY: Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned.
(Exit Judge Vandelay)
GEORGE: You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
ELAINE: Puddy, don't wait for me.
PUDDY: Alright.
FRANK: We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
SIDRA: Come on, Jackie. Let's go.
JERRY: What?
CHILES: Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.
[The group, walking back to the holding cell]
JERRY: Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
KRAMER: Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
ELAINE: Why don't you just blow it out your a...
(They enter the cell)
ELAINE: If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
JERRY: Sure.
ELAINE: Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
JERRY: I think that would be a very nice gesture.
KRAMER: I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
JERRY: See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
GEORGE: Haven't we had this conversation before?
JERRY: You think?
GEORGE: I think we have.
JERRY: Yeah, maybe we have.
[Epilogue, on stage in the prison]
JERRY: So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
PRISONER 1: I am.
JERRY: I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
PRISONER 2: Murder one.
JERRY: Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
PRISONER 3: Grand theft auto.
JERRY: Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
PRISONER 3: You suck - I'm gonna cut you.
JERRY: Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
GUARD: Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.
JERRY: Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
