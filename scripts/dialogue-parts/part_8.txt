d five years.
JERRY: Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
KRAMER: Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
(Kramer heads for the door.)
JERRY: I didn't know you had a hopper.
KRAMER: (smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
(Kramer exits, closing the door behind him.)
[Conference Room, J. Peterman]
(A number of executives are seated round a table, with J Peterman at the head of the table.)
PETERMAN: Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
(Peterman indicates a guy sitting next to Elaine. The other executives give Bob some quiet applause, which he acknowledges with a slight wave.)
BOB: Thanks. Hi everybody.
PETERMAN: Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
(Elaine leans over to the guy sitting on the other side of her from Bob.)
ELAINE: (whispers) Poor bastard.
PETERMAN: (to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the copy-editing for the new catalogue.
(Bob looks blank and fiddles with something behind his ear.)
BOB: Ah, could you repeat that?
PETERMAN: (slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
(Bob pulls a face and points to indicate all is not well with his hearing.)
BOB: (apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?
PETERMAN: (louder still) Copy-editing!
(Peterman sees he's not getting through to Bob, and gives up.)
PETERMAN: Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
(Elaine does a double-take at hearing this, looking dismayed. Bob has a hearing aid out of his ear and manipulates it before slipping it back in.)
[Friars Club Lobby]
(Jerry, George, Susan, and Hallie stand before the maitre d' of the rather fancy Friars Club. Jerry has no jacket)
JERRY: Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
MAITRE D': Yes, Mr Seinfeld, but uhm, all gentlemen are required to wear jackets in the dining room.
JERRY: (downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
HALLIE: (smiling) How embarrassing this must be for you.
JERRY: (jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
(George, Susan and Hallie laugh at his little joke.)
MAITRE D': No problem. Please, follow me.
(The maitre d' strides away, Jerry follows.)
JERRY: (passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
GEORGE: (smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
(A couple of people walk by, George raises a hand in greeting.)
GEORGE: Friars.
(Jerry returns, wearing a blazer, with a crest on the breast pocket.)
JERRY: Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
(George, Susan and Hallie, all make positive noises and comments. The maitre d' comes up behind Jerry and motions them to enter.)
MAITRE D': This way please.
GEORGE: Hup, here we go. Here we go.
(The four of them walk on into the restaurant, with George bringing up the rear.)
[Friars Club Restaurant]
(Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie, sit round a table, eating. They're engage in at least two separate conversations - Jerry with George and Susan with Hallie.)
GEORGE: (adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
(Jerry looks scornfully at George.)
SUSAN: (to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish. It's really delicious.
(Hallie spears a morsel from Susan's plate and eats it.)
JERRY: (to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
GEORGE: (to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.
JERRY: (to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
HALLIE: (to Susan) Mmm, it is good.
SUSAN: (to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?
GEORGE: (to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
HALLIE: (to Susan) Oh. Remember (indistinct) wedding?
JERRY: Oh, come on.
GEORGE: Look...
JERRY: Alright.
(The four continue chatting happily.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer is asleep on Jerry's couch. Jerry enters, wearing a long coat.)
JERRY: (looking at Kramer) This is nice.
(Jerry slams the door and Kramer jerks awake.)
KRAMER: Yeah, morning.
JERRY: Morning?
(Jerry removes his coat, to reveal he's wearing the crested jacket from the Friars Club.)
KRAMER: Yeah, what time is it?
JERRY: (looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
KRAMER: (pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
(Kramer passes Jerry on his way to the kitchen. Jerry looks downwards at his attire.)
JERRY: (realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
(Kramer has a bowl on the counter and fetches a box of cereal. )
KRAMER: Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
JERRY: Breakfast?
KRAMER: (pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
JERRY: So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
KRAMER: (enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
JERRY: What d'you call it?
KRAMER: P B and J's. What d'you think?
JERRY: (deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
KRAMER: (dismissive) Ahh.
(Kramer picks up his bowl of cereal and heads for the door. )
JERRY: So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
(Kramer stops, with the door open, and turns back to Jerry. )
KRAMER: I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
JERRY: Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
KRAMER: (laughing) He he, yeah.
(Kramer begins to exit. )
JERRY: (indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
KRAMER: Oh, I'll be back.
(Kramer leaves and closes the door behind him.)
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
(It's late at night, and her's is the only light on in the building. Elaine sits at a computer, typing away at the keyboard. She's surrounded by piles of paperwork, which she rummages through. She sighs, frustrated at being saddled with all this work. )
[Jerry's Apartment]
(It's night, and Jerry lies in bed asleep. Kramer enters the room quietly and sits on the edge of Jerry's bed. )
KRAMER: (quietly) Jerry.
(Jerry stirs slightly, but doesn't wake up. )
KRAMER: (quietly) Hey Jerry.
(Jerry still doesn't wake. )
KRAMER: (prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
(Jerry snaps awake, sitting up and recoiling from the figure on his bed. )
JERRY: (startled) Kramer!
KRAMER: You awake?
JERRY: (confused) Wha..? What time is it?
KRAMER: W...It's four.
JERRY: (aghast) Four in the morning?!
KRAMER: Yeah.
JERRY: Well, what's wrong with you?
KRAMER: I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
JERRY: No. Would you just get out?
KRAMER: You wanna rent a movie?
JERRY: No!
KRAMER: Well, what am I gonna do?
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
(Jerry walks over to Elaine, who is working at her computer. She has a sandwich and a diet soda on her desk.)
JERRY: Ready for lunch?
ELAINE: (irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
(Jerry pulls a face, helps himself to a sandwich and sits down, as Elaine turns to him.)
ELAINE: Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
JERRY: You think he's faking?
ELAINE: I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
(Bob leans around the open door to speak.)
BOB: Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
(Jerry waves a finger in greeting.)
BOB: (to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.
(Bob makes to depart, but stops as Elaine speaks.)
ELAINE: Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
BOB: (cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
(Elaine leans toward Bob.)
ELAINE: (slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
(Bob smiles, and holds his tie, as if he's been complimented on it.)
BOB: Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
(Bob smiles, gives Elaine a wink and leaves.)
ELAINE: Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
JERRY: That was him?
ELAINE: Yes.
JERRY: Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
ELAINE: Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
JERRY: (standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
(Elaine turns back to her computer. Jerry heads out the door.)
ELAINE: Alright.
[Peterman Bathroom]
(Bob stands at the urinal. Jerry opens the door and enters the room. He sees Bob, and wonders about something. Jerry slowly crosses the room until he's standing about three feet behind Bob.)
JERRY: Hey, Bob.
(Bob continues to use the urinal, without reaction.)
JERRY: Bob.
(Still no reaction.)
JERRY: Hey, Bobby, over here.
(Bob continues his necessary business.)
JERRY: Bob. Oh, Bob.
(Still nothing.)
JERRY: (louder) Bob!
(Bob finishes what he has to do, and half-turns to find Jerry behind him. Jerry feigns innocence, Bob completes his zipping up whilst faced away from Jerry.
BOB: Hi.
(Jerry and Bob give embarrassed acknowledgement smiles.)
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
(Elaine types away at her computer. Jerry enters.)
JERRY: (urgent whisper) Elaine.
(Jerry closes the door behind him.)
ELAINE: (makes an irked noise)
JERRY: I was just in the bathroom.
ELAINE: (really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
JERRY: No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
ELAINE: So what?
JERRY: No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
(Elaine stands and slaps Jerry on the chest with a bundle of papers.)
ELAINE: Get out! What'd you do?
JERRY: Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
ELAINE: (hopeful) And?
JERRY: Well, he flinched, sort of.
ELAINE: What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
JERRY: Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
ELAINE: So you don't know anything?
JERRY: Actually, no.
ELAINE: (sarcasm) Alright, good job.
JERRY: Right.
(Elaine goes back to work. Jerry leaves.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry sits, reading a paper, at the table. There is a knock at the door.)
JERRY: Come in.
(The door slowly opens wide enough for George to lean into the room. He's smiling, looks at Jerry and raises his eyebrows quizzically. Jerry smiles back.)
GEORGE: (entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
JERRY: That was something.
GEORGE: Ah. She's great, isn't she?
JERRY: (positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
GEORGE: I told you.
JERRY: I'm nuts about her.
GEORGE: You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
JERRY: She could be an 'it'.
GEORGE: (claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
JERRY: She's got 'it' written all over her.
GEORGE: She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
JERRY: Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
GEORGE: Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
JERRY: Whatever.
GEORGE: (gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
JERRY: That doesn't sound right.
GEORGE: No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
JERRY: Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
GEORGE: Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
JERRY: Walk me down to the Friars.
(Jerry goes into the bedroom.)
GEORGE: Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
(Jerry reenters looking confused.)
JERRY: It's not here.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
(Kramer enters, rubbing his eyes.)
KRAMER: Oh, boy.
(Jerry is looking around for the jacket, lifting cushions, etc.)
JERRY: (to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
KRAMER: Oh, the one with the crest.
JERRY: Yeah.
JERRY: Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
JERRY: The cleaners? How did it get there?
KRAMER: Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
JERRY: (irritated) Great.
KRAMER: (laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
JERRY: Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
KRAMER: Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
JERRY: Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
GEORGE: Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
(Kramer has closed his eyes and fallen asleep while leaning on the counter in Jerry's kitchen.)
JERRY: (to Kramer) Hey.
(Kramer does not respond.)
JERRY: (louder) Hey!!
(Kramer snaps awake with a jerk.)
KRAMER: Watch out, boy.
[Bob's Office, J. Peterman]
(Bob is working at his desk, with his back to the door. Elaine arrives and stands in the doorway.)
ELAINE: Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
(Bob continues to muse over some of the work in front of him, giving no sign of knowing Elaine is there.)
ELAINE: Bob!
(Bob still doesn't react to Elaine. Elaine takes a couple of steps into Bob's office, and decides to try a different tactic.)
ELAINE: (sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
(As Elaine speaks, Peterman walks past the open door. Hearing Elaine's voice, his attention is caught. He stops to listen.)
ELAINE: ...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
(Peterman watches and listens, surprised.)
ELAINE: (sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
(Peterman decides he should withdraw, and he leaves.)
ELAINE: (dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
(Bob continues to be oblivious to Elaine. Elaine pulls a pensive face and leaves.)
[Theatre]
(George, Susan and Hallie sit in a box overlooking the stage (just like the two guys in the Muppets). There's an empty seat beside Hallie. George is making small talk.)
HALLIE: Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly.
GEORGE: A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.
HALLIE: Yeah.
(Jerry arrives, wearing the crested jacket.)
JERRY: Sorry, sorry I'm late.
GEORGE/SUSAN: Hey!
SUSAN: Jerry.
GEORGE: Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
(Jerry takes the vacant seat.)
JERRY: Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
GEORGE: Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
JERRY: Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
(Lively music begins and the Flying Sandos Brothers bound onto the stage to applause from the auditorium. Jerry and his friends all join in.)
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Kramer sits on his couch with Connie, who is playfully toying with the collar on his shirt.)
KRAMER: So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
CONNIE: Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you.
KRAMER: Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
(Connie leans in and begins to kiss Kramer's neck.)
KRAMER: Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
[Theatre]
(The Sandos Brothers are on stage performing a juggling act with glasses, trays and bottle. It ends with them pouring drinks and toasting the audience. The audience applaud appreciatively.)
(The Sandos Brothers launch into the next part of their act. One brother climbs onto the shoulders of another and is carried to the edge of the stage, where he climbs from the shoulders into the box containing Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie. The audience applaud.)
SANDOS BROTHER 1: How would you kind people like to lend a hand with our next trick?
JERRY: (smiling) I don't think so.
SANDOS BROTHER 1: Please, take off your jacket.
JERRY: My jacket?
SANDOS BROTHER 1: Yes, the jacket. (turns to the crowd) What do you say, ladies and gentlemen?
(The rest of the audience cheer and clap.)
SANDOS BROTHER 1: (to Jerry) Can't argue with that.
HALLIE: C'mon.
SUSAN: Do it. Come on, Jerry.
GEORGE: Give him the jacket.
JERRY: (giving in) Alright.
(Jerry shrugs out of the jacket, to the applause of friends and audience. He hands it to the Sandos Brother.)
SANDOS BROTHER 1: And now, we say the magic word. (gestures with his hand) Agrabah! And we make it disappear.
(As he finishes his speech, he tosses the jacket out of the box and into the audience. The audience clap, as do George, Susan and Hallie. Jerry peers over the edge of the box, after the jacket.)
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Connie lies on the couch, underneath Kramer. She strokes the side of his head with her fingers.)
CONNIE: (passionate) Oh Cosmo. Mm-mmm, Cosmo. Oh Cosmo.
(Kramer is oddly unresponsive.)
CONNIE: (uncomfortable) Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts.
(Kramer makes no reply.)
CONNIE: (worried) Cosmo?
(Connie pushes at Kramer to try and move him.)
CONNIE: (panicky) Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up!
(Connie heaves harder at Kramer, but he's still not moving or replying.)
CONNIE: Cosmo?
(Connie lifts Kramer's head and looks at his face, which is completely slack and expressionless.)
CONNIE: (horrified) Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead.
(Panicky, Connie tries again to lift Kramer enough to get out, but is unable to move his inert bulk. She reaches across to the table and grabs the handset of the phone. Quickly, she dials a number and puts the phone to her ear.)
CONNIE: (into phone) Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some guy dropped dead on top of me. (listens) I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might find out. (listens) I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me.
[Theatre, Backstage]
(Jerry leads George and the girls up to a door marked 'Dressing Room 3'.)
GEORGE: This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
(Jerry knocks on the door. It's opened after a second, by one of the Sandos Brothers who looks at Jerry, questioningly.)
JERRY: Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
SANDOS BROTHER 2: Jacket? What jacket?
JERRY: (explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
SANDOS BROTHER 2: A..are you sure it was me?
JERRY: Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
(Jerry looks past to where another couple of Sandos Brother are still changing.)
SANDOS BROTHER 2: Well, two of them have left already.
(The Sandos Brother at the door turns to the other two an rattles off a question in some foreign language. The other two speak to each other and reply to the question, also in a foreign tongue, but clearly they don't know anything.)
SANDOS BROTHER 2: (shaking his head apologetically) No.
JERRY: It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
SANDOS BROTHER 2: Sorry.
(The Sandos Brother closes the door, smiling.)
HALLIE: Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
JERRY: (cynical) I'm sure it won't.
HALLIE: Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.
GEORGE: (cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
JERRY: (downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
SUSAN: Aww, that's too bad.
GEORGE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah, we'll do it another time.
SUSAN: (bright) George, we'll go.
(George doesn't look like the prospect of coffee alone with Susan is something he relishes.)
[Monk's]
(George and Susan sit either side of a table, with coffee. There's a definite lack of sparkling conversation. George forces a smile at Susan. There's a long pause, broken only by Susan sighing. George finally thinks of something to say.)
GEORGE: I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
SUSAN: Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.
GEORGE: Okay.
SUSAN: So, what colour?
GEORGE: Brown.
(Susan nods her comprehension, as George muses for a moment.)
GEORGE: Maybe a black.
SUSAN: Mmm.
(The waitress walks by the table with the coffee pot.)
WAITRESS: More coffee?
GEORGE: (urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
(The waitress pulls the check from her pocket and puts it on the table for George.)
[Hallway Outside Jerry's Apartment]
(As Jerry walks up to his door, Kramer's door opens and two guys emerge carrying a large body-shaped object wrapped in fabric. They carry it away down the hall.)
JERRY: (looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
(Jerry shakes his head at Kramer's antics as he enters his apartment.)
[A Lonely Stretch Of Road On The Banks Of The Hudson]
(It is night. A large black car squeals to a stop beside the river. The two guys we just saw leave Kramer's apartment climb out of the car. They open the trunk and haul out the wrapped object they were carrying. They lug it to the rail at the edge of the road, and heave it over the edge. It splashes into the river and begins to sink. The two guys quickly close the trunk of the car and climb back in.)
[Beneath The Hudson River]
(The object sinks down into the water. Suddenly, the contents begin to squirm and jump. The outline of a human body can be seen within the fabric. The top of the wrappings opens and Kramer emerges. He looks around, wide-eyed, and would scream with shock, were he not underwater. He kicks his legs and swims toward the surface.)
[The Hudson River]
(Kramer breaks the surface with a splutter. He looks round, panicky and confused.)
KRAMER: HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
(Kramer looks to one side, where he sees a large ferry bearing down on him. He turns and begins swimming away from the vessel.)
KRAMER: AAH! AAGH!
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
(Elaine is working away, when Peterman enters behind her. He's carrying a couple of bits of card.)
PETERMAN: Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
(Peterman sits on the edge of Elaine's desk.)
ELAINE: (shrugging it off) Oh.
PETERMAN: So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.
ELAINE: (pleased) Ah.
PETERMAN: It is a real hoot.
ELAINE: (delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
PETERMAN: Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a little early, so you both can get ready.
(Elaine looks confused. Peterman begins to leave.)
ELAINE: Mr Peterman, you...
PETERMAN: (interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every word you said.
(Elaine realises what Peterman overheard.)
PETERMAN: And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap. (staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.
ELAINE: (resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is on the phone, as George enters.)
JERRY: (into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
(Jerry stalks about as George sits on the couch.)
JERRY: (worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
GEORGE: It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
GEORGE: (worried) Why not?
JERRY: (impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
GEORGE: (standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?
JERRY: Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
GEORGE: You're soured?
JERRY: Yeah, I'm soured.
GEORGE: Don't be soured.
JERRY: I'm sorry. I'm soured.
GEORGE: (animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
JERRY: Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
GEORGE: (animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
JERRY: (indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
GEORGE: (worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
JERRY: I'll try and de-sour.
GEORGE: (aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
JERRY: (sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
GEORGE: I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
JERRY: I still don't know what that means.
GEORGE: (neither does he) Yeah, well.
(The door opens and Kramer enters, fully dressed but soaked to the skin.)
KRAMER: God.
JERRY: (astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
KRAMER: (animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
JERRY: Who?
KRAMER: (shouts) Connie!
JERRY: What'd she do?
KRAMER: I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
JERRY: (bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
KRAMER: (animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
(Kramer moves to leave, but walks into the door with a loud thud.)
KRAMER: (to door) Gah!
(Kramer stomps away to his own apartment.)
[Friars Club Lobby]
(Jerry and George stand where they dealt with the maitre d' on their previous visit. As they wait, they're people-watching.)
JERRY: Hey, there's uncle Milty.
GEORGE: (pleased) Yeah, it is.
JERRY: (pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
GEORGE: The comedian, or the manager?
JERRY: The manager.
(George looks unimpressed. Pat Cooper comes walking toward Jerry and George.)
JERRY: (to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
PAT: Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are you a kleptomaniac, or what?
JERRY: I forgot to take it off.
PAT: (dubious) You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store, you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an idiot?
JERRY: I'm sorry.
PAT: Where's the jacket?
JERRY: Well, one of the gypsies took it.
PAT: (skeptical) Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!
GEORGE: (meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.
PAT: (probing) Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?
GEORGE: No, I uh...
PAT: (interrupting) Then what am I talking to you for? (to Jerry) Jerry, bring the jacket back tomorrow.
JERRY: Alright.
(Pat Cooper walks away from the guys. Jerry motions for George to leave with him. George looks round and sees something.)
GEORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute.
(Over at one of the tables, the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket is entertaining some other guests. He's wearing a familiar crested jacket.)
GEORGE: Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
JERRY: God, you're right.
GEORGE: (motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
(Jerry and George walk into the Friars Club, but within a couple of strides they are faced with the maitre d'.)
MAITRE D': Wait a second! Excuse me gentlemen, are you members?
JERRY: Well, I'm a prospective member.
MAITRE D': Until then, (pointing) that's the way out.
JERRY: But that guy has my jacket.
MAITRE D': C'mon, let's go.
(The maitre d' shepherds Jerry and George out of the door, despite their continuing protests.)
GEORGE: Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
MAITRE D': Come on.
JERRY: Come on.
MAITRE D': Let's go.
GEORGE: If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
(Jerry and George are ejected from the Friars Club.)
[Theatre]
(Elaine and Bob sit in the same box used by Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie. Elaine looks distinctly unenthused at the prospect of spending the evening with Bob. Bob looks delighted to be ensconced with Elaine.)
BOB: These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us these tickets.
ELAINE: (flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
(Bob slips one hand round the back of Elaine's seat and leans slightly toward her.)
BOB: (smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
(Elaine looks at Bob, wondering what he's talking about. Bob dives across at Elaine, putting his arms round her and his face on her chest.)
ELAINE: (pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
(Elaine succeeds in heaving Bob away from her. She looks at him, angrily.)
ELAINE: Get offa me!
(Bob stands for a few seconds, with Elaine glaring at him. Then he dives in for another go. Elaine struggles with him again.)
ELAINE: Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
(Bob slowly gets to his feet. Elaine glares at him, and Bob shamefacedly shuffles away out of the box.)
[Theatre, Backstage]
(Jerry and George come round a corner in a dingy corridor at the theatre.)
JERRY: I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
GEORGE: I told you, he probably went out the back.
(Along the corridor comes the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket. He has a jacket slung over one shoulder. Jerry and George collide with him.)
JERRY: Ouf.
(Jerry recognises the guy.)
JERRY: Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
SANDOS BROTHER 1: No, it is not. It is my jacket.
(The Sandos Brother backs away from the advancing Jerry and George.)
JERRY: (adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
SANDOS BROTHER 1: No, it is not. This is mine.
JERRY: C'mon I need it.
(Jerry grabs hold of the jacket and begins a tug-of-war with it. George joins in, trying to release the grip of the Sandos Brother. The door to 'Dressing Room 3' opens and Hallie emerges and watches the struggle.)
JERRY: (determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
GEORGE: Give 'im the jacket already!
(Jerry and George succeed in taking the jacket. The Sandos Brother runs away down the corridor, shouting.)
SANDOS BROTHER 1: (yelling) Help! Help! (foreign language) Azobar! Azobar disay!
GEORGE: What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
JERRY: Can you believe it?!
(Jerry looks at the jacket they took, and notices something.)
JERRY: (examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
GEORGE: Moose?
JERRY: Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
HALLIE: No, it's not.
(Hallie reaches inside the door of Dressing Room 3 and pulls out a jacket on a hanger.)
HALLIE: This is the jacket.
(Jerry and George look mortified. Hallie brings the jacket over to Jerry.)
JERRY: Ohh, you got the jacket back.
GEORGE: Ohh, yeahh.
JERRY: (taking the jacket) Thank you.
HALLIE: It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they gave it back to you.
JERRY: Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
GEORGE: (smiling) That is really nice.
HALLIE: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
HALLIE: Yeah.
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: This is nice.
JERRY: Yeahh.
HALLIE: Yeah.
GEORGE: (forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
HALLIE: (flat) I'll see you at the wedding.
(Hallie walks away, leaving George's Gatsby ambitions in tatters.)
[Theatre]
(Elaine sits alone in the box. Something on the floor catches her eye. It's Bob's hearing-aid earpiece. Elaine picks it up, and it occurs to her that she has the opportunity she wanted. She wipes the earpiece on the lapel of her jacket and carefully slips it over her ear. Elaine cocks her head on one side, listening to see if it makes a difference.)
[Theatre, Backstage]
(Jerry and George walk along backstage. Jerry has his jacket, and George is carrying the Sandos Brother's jacket, looking sullen.)
GEORGE: (moody) Great! Now she's sour!
JERRY: Maybe she'll sweeten.
GEORGE: (angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
(Behind Jerry and George, the Flying Sandos Brothers appear. They look over toward Jerry and George.)
SANDOS BROTHER 1: (pointing) There they are!
(The Sandos Brothers set off running after Jerry and George. George hurriedly puts the jacket down on a table, as he and Jerry begin to hasten.)
GEORGE: Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
(Jerry and George run away, as the Sandos Brothers advance.)
(George is on the lead as he and Jerry reach a door marked 'Emergency Exit. Alarm will sound'. George pushes the door open and he and Jerry dart through. As they do, a loud alarm bell begins to ring.)
[Theatre]
(Elaine is sitting wearing the earpiece when the alarm sounds. Obviously, the earpiece works, as Elaine spasms in pain at the ringing. She clutches her hands to her ears and jerks off her seat, falling out of sight onto the floor of the box.)
[Hallway, Apartment Building]
(Kramer stands outside the door to an apartment, flanked by two other guys. One of the guys knocks at the door. After a few seconds, it is opened by Connie.)
KRAMER: (pointing) That's her, officer.
CONNIE: (shocked) Kramer! Oh my god, I thought you were...
KRAMER: (animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
(The detective shows his shield to Connie.)
DETECTIVE: You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.
CONNIE: (defensive) I didn't do anything.
KRAMER: (sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!
DETECTIVE: Get your coat, we gotta take you in.
CONNIE: Can I call my lawyer?
DETECTIVE: Okay, go ahead.
(Connie goes back into her apartment.)
[Connie's Apartment/Lawyer's Office]
CONNIE: (on phone) You gotta meet me at the police station. They're arresting me for attempted murder.
(On the phone in his office is Jackie Chiles.)
JACKIE: Attempted murder? Of whom?
CONNIE: This guy, Kramer.
JACKIE: Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?
CONNIE: (surprised) Yeah, that's right.
JACKIE: (adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
(Jackie puts down his phone and looks glad to have escaped.)
[Opening monologue]
I really like the wig historically. I guess the revolutionary war, the last war fought in wig, and it seems that it must have been hard. You know they're going in to battle,they think Well do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby pins.. and you got to make sure you have everything... lot more to worry about What if I get killed.? Is my wig on straight? I don't know when the whole wig thing came in to style for men... but I know when it went out.! When the mirror was invented. No guy is looking in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair on his head going ..All right! lets go rap (?) to the ladies..
[At the Andover shop]
JERRY: I'm looking for a crested blazer
CRAIG: A crested blazer..
JERRY: I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
CRAIG: (turning around): Yes .I Think we may have something. (picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest.... That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn.
JERRY: (softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
CRAIG: It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?
JERRY: You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
CRAIG: (doubtful) A Hum!
JERRY: Really I'll be back.
CRAIG: Yeah!
[Cuts to Jerry's apartment.]
(George is pacing back and forth with the phone and Elaine and Jerry are talking.)
JERRY: So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
ELAINE: Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
JERRY: Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
ELAINE: That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
JERRY: Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
ELAINE: But you were!!
JERRY: But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
GEORGE:(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
(Kramer walks in.)
JERRY: (to George) Problems with the house guest?
ELAINE: What house guest?
GEORGE: This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
KRAMER: Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
ELAINE: Who is he?
GEORGE: He's a wig master
ELAINE: What is a wig master?
GEORGE: He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
JERRY: Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
KRAMER: About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
GEORGE: (leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
KRAMER: Euh what...What lot is that?
GEORGE: Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
KRAMER: Seventy -five bucks a month!
GEORGE: Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
KRAMER: Oh I'm down.
[Cuts to the Andover shop]
JERRY: (proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
CRAIG: No I believed you.
JERRY: Yeah.... well Elaine.
ELAINE: (looking up to the salesman)
CRAIG: Oh!... hello I'm Craig.
ELAINE: .....Hi.
CRAIG: well (picks up the blazer again) here it is.
ELAINE: Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
CRAIG: You know your coats?
ELAINE: Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
CRAIG: I love J. Peterman.

CRAIG: I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away..
ELAINE: Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
CRAIG: No!!!
ELAINE: Yeeeahh!!!
JERRY: (impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
Elaine Well I love it...
JERRY: You what??
ELAINE: I think it's great. I think you should get it.
CRAIG: Well .... Will it be check or credit card?
JERRY: (giving up) Check.
CRAIG: I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me. (turning to Elaine) Perhaps you could do the same.
ELAINE: (laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
[Cuts to a street where Jerry & Elaine are walking]
JERRY: You weren't supposed to say that.
ELAINE: But I really did like it
JERRY: That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
ELAINE: uhn... Sorry!
JERRY: And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
ELAINE: What is the big deal!!
JERRY: ...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
ELAINE: He dared....
[Cuts to George's apartment as he comes in.]
ETHAN: (sitting in the couch and combing his wigs)Hi George.. How was your day?
GEORGE: Good....good day (not too convincing) You?
ETHAN: I am getting so much work done..... See?
GEORGE: Very nice
SUSAN: (walks in) Hi sweety How was your day?
ETHAN: I already ask him that. He said Good...Good day....
(George scratches his head and the scene cuts to Jerry and Kramer's hallway)
KRAMER: (frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?

KRAMER: I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
JERRY: Forget it.
KRAMER: Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
JERRY: He wont take ya..
(Kramer picks up the phone, calls George; Phone rings at George's and he's sitting between Susan and the wig master.)
GEORGE: (grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
KRAMER: Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
GEORGE: Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
[Cuts to George's car. Kramer changes the stations on the radio]
GEORGE: So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
GEORGE: WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!
KRAMER: I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)

JERRY: How do you know she's not my wife?
[Cuts to the Jiffy Park]
GEORGE: I want to know how did that get into my car?
ATTENDANT: Hey look ..You walk in to this city you got to expect things are gonna stick to your foot. You open in your car and Bing!! Condom.
GEORGE: That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
ATTENDANT: Here take a few shirts....
(A man walks over the attendant and whispers in to his ears.)
ATTENDANT: I'm terribly sorry Mr Kramer but we can't get your car now, the keys seems to have been misplaced.
KRAMER: Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.

[Scene cuts to George's apartment.]
SUSAN: ..So you're telling me the truth?
GEORGE: Of Course I'm telling the truth.
SUSAN: Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that this can work.
GEORGE: Really!
SUSAN: Yeah.
GEORGE: Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
SUSAN: There's no doubt.

ELAINE: So you're giving him a discount too?
CRAIG: Hummm Why so surprised?
ELAINE: Hem!! No reason.
[Cuts to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Kramer are watching tv.]
JERRY: You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
KRAMER: Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in
JERRY: Turn in?
KRAMER: Yeah,I had a tough day
JERRY: It's only nine o clock.
KRAMER: Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
JERRY: I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
KRAMER: Well you can go to your room and read.
JERRY: Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
KRAMER: But I'm tired..
JERRY: Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
KRAMER: Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
JERRY: Well that's all I got.
KRAMER: Can I sleep with you?
JERRY: Huh?
KRAMER: Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
JERRY: Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
KRAMER: Why?
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: Yeah!
JERRY: Do I really have to explain why?
KRAMER: Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
ELAINE: Hi!.
KRAMER: Hi...........What's that?
ELAINE: Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
KRAMER: Wow.
ELAINE: You want it?
KRAMER: Yeaaahmm....
ELAINE: You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
KRAMER: Ooh Mama...( walks away)
ELAINE: Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
JERRY: Yeah Why?
ELAINE: Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
JERRY: So ,Who is he?
ELAINE: Some friend of his from England.
JERRY: Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
ELAINE: You're nuts!
KRAMER: How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
ELAINE: What d'you mean?
KRAMER: What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
ELAINE: Aawwh Please.....
KRAMER: Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
[Scene cuts to Jerry's bed. Lights are out. Kramer opens the light and starts to read.]
KRAMER: (softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale.
[Cuts to the Jiffy Park the next morning.]
GEORGE: Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
ATTENDANT: Whats the problem
GEORGE: You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
ATTENDANT: Haaan! That is all hearsay.
GEORGE: Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
ATTENDANT: Can't do it'
GEORGE: Whadday'mean.?
ATTENDANT: If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable.
GEORGE: Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
ATTENDANT: What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs.
GEORGE:. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
ATTENDANT: Well that's going to be a problem
GEORGE: Why?
ATTENDANT: It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days.
GEORGE: What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
ATTENDANT: We ask that you please bear with us.
GEORGE: Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
THEIR CARS!!!
ATTENDANT: Ideally..
[Scene cuts to the Andover shop.]
JERRY: Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
TELLER: Certainly. May I ask why?
JERRY: ........For spite...
TELLER: Spite?
JERRY: That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
TELLER: I don't think you can return an item for spite.
JERRY: What do you mean?
TELLER: Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way, then we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund
JERRY: That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
TELLER: Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!
(walks over to the manager and whispers)
TELLER: ........spite.....(Manager walks over)
BOB: What seems to be the problem?
JERRY: Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
BOB: That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite.
JERRY:. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
BOB: Well you already said spite so......
JERRY: But I changed my mind..
BOB: No...you said spite...Too late.

(A man approaches.)
JESSIE: Ethan?
ETHAN: Yes..
JESSIE:. Hi it's me Jessie....George Hamilton's personal assistant.

JERRY: (Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
JESSIE: Yeah...I guess you could say that..
JERRY: Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
JESSIE: I dunno I just didn't think you were.
JERRY: Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
JESSIE: I dont know. I just didn't.
JERRY: Well it's very emasculating..
(Jessie looks befuddled and leaves.)
[Back to Elaine's phone rings.]
ELAINE: Hello.
BOB:. Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this number.
ELAINE: Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
BOB: Well.....
ELAINE: Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
BOB: Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is.
ELAINE: Well do you have any in a... size four.?
BOB: Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven.
ELAINE: (sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
[Scene cuts to a woman in a white coat and hat leaving a store. Her hat gets caught in a gust of wind. and starts rolling down the street. Kramer picks up the hat with the walking stick and puts it on. He struts down the street with the Dreamcoat/hat/stick looking very much like a stereotype pimp. He goes to the Jiffy Park to pick up the Cadillac]
KRAMER: (looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
(Out comes the hooker with a client.)
KRAMER: Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
HOOKER: Hey. You just cost me some money Mr.(starts hitting Kramer)
KRAMER: Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
POLICE: Policer officer. Freeze right there.
(As the credits roll we hear an officer telling Kramer who is to get his picture taken.)
POLICE: OK Big Daddy. Take the hat off...... awright turn to your right...(Kramer hesitates) I SAID TURN PIMP.
KRAMER: (cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.
[George in a meeting at Yankee Stadium]
GEORGE: I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
MR. STEINBRENNER: All the way to the floor! What are you crazy! You'd suffocate in there. Your lucky you have any doors at all. You know when I was in the army...... Hey Costanza. What's that your eating over there? It looks pretty tasty.
GEORGE: It's a calzone, sir.
MR. STEINBRENNER: A calzone huh. Pass it down here. Let's have a look at at it. I want a little taste. Come on, come on. Pass it down here. That's a good boy. Okay. What's in this thing?
GEORGE: Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
MR. STEINBRENNER: Eggplant. Yes. That's a hell of a thing. Okay let's get back to business. Okay here you go. Very good, very good. Excellent. excellent calzone you got there Costanza. Okay a little jealous now. Okay lets go. Ok last week....... You know that eggplant was very good. Everybody out. I got eggplant on my mind. Costanza get me couple of those calzones right now. Pronto. Move out. Pigstein what's an eggplant calzone. Must have one. Everybody out. Out.
[Jerry and Elaine at apartment]
ELAINE: One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
JERRY: What bet?
ELAINE: He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
JERRY: Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
ELAINE: That's what I said.
JERRY: So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: Huh.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY: No. nothing.
(Kramer walks in)
JERRY: What's with you?
KRAMER: Feel this.
JERRY: Wow.That's hot.
KRAMER: Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
ELAINE: I'll see you later.
KRAMER: Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
JERRY: So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
KRAMER: Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
JERRY: I got a date with Nikki.
KRAMER: Oh yeah she's a beauty.
JERRY: She's also quite bold.
KRAMER: Oh bold and beautiful.
[George and Mr. Steinbrenner at Yankee Stadium]
MR. STEINBRENNER: I am loving this calzone. The pita pocket prevents it from dripping. The pita pocket. (phone rings)What is it Watson? A lost and found. No. I don't think we need that. If people keel over because they lost something that's there tough luck. You got a drip on your mouth by the way.
GEORGE: You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
MR. STEINBRENNER: Hold on Watson. You like lost and found George?
GEORGE: Definitely.
MR. STEINBRENNER: All right lost and found. But these got to be a time limit. We're not running a pawn shop here.
[Jerry and Nikki at movies]
JERRY: Hey, Elaine.
ELAINE: Hi Jerry!
JERRY: This is Nikki.
NIKKI: Hi!
ELAINE: Hello. This is Todd Gack.
JERRY: Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
ELAINE: So what movie are you guys seeing?
NIKKI:"Means to an End"
ELAINE: Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
JERRY: Why don't you see what you can do?
NIKKI: Okay.
ELAINE: What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
JERRY: We'll see.
TODD: Hey Jerry. Do you like cigars?
JERRY: Yeah. Why?
TODD: I am going to Montreal tomorrow and they sell them dirt cheap.
JERRY: Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
TODD: So do you want a box?
JERRY: Sure. If there cheap Why not.
TODD: All right I buy a box and give to Elaine.
NIKKI: Okay two tickets"Means to an End"
JERRY: Told you.
ELAINE: How did you do that?
NIKKI: I just talked to the manager.
JERRY: All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
[Jerry and George at the coffee shop]
GEORGE: There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
JERRY: There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
GEORGE: Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
JERRY: With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
GEORGE: So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
JERRY: So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
GEORGE: Not bills.
JERRY: So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
GEORGE: Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
JERRY: She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
GEORGE: Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
[Jerry and Kramer at his apartment]
KRAMER: Hey buddy.
JERRY: What the hell is all this?
KRAMER: I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
JERRY: Why can't you do this on your table?
KRAMER: Because I don't have a table.
(Elaine walks in)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
ELAINE: Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
JERRY: Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
(Kramer leaves)
ELAINE: No. We were both in the mood for one.
JERRY: You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
ELAINE: Oh is that so.
JERRY: Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
ELAINE: What are you talking about?
JERRY: Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
ELAINE: If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
JERRY: Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
ELAINE: I don't buy it.
(Kramer walks in with more change)
JERRY: So what happened after the movie?
ELAINE: Nothing. He walked me home.
JERRY: To the door?
ELAINE: Yeah.
JERRY: That's a date.
ELAINE: No it's not.
JERRY: But I never walk you home.
ELAINE: That's just because your a jackass.
KRAMER: Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
JERRY: No, no.
ELAINE: No, no.
JERRY: So how did you leave it with him?
ELAINE: I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
JERRY: That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
ELAINE: Your crazy!
JERRY: Crazy like a man.
[George at Pisano's]
WORKER: Number 49.
GEORGE: You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
WORKER: $ 6.50 your change.
GEORGE: And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
WORKER: Hey! You steal my money!!
GEORGE: No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
WORKER: I know what you try to do. Get out. Don't ever come back ever.
[George and Mr. Steinbrenner at Yankee Stadium]
GEORGE: I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
MR. STEINBRENNER: Beautiful. I am starving George.
GEORGE: I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
MR. STEINBRENNER: Corn beef. I don't think so. It is a little fatty.
GEORGE: How about Chinese?
MR. STEINBRENNER: Uhhhhh. No. Too many containers. Big mess, big mess. Too sloppy.I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's. That's the ticket.
GEORGE: I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
MR. STEINBRENNER: No, no, no. George let me tell you something. When I find something I like I stick with it. From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same lunch everyday. Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread. Bread bowl George. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl. There's nothing more satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table.
[Todd walking Elaine to her apartment]
ELAINE: Thanks for the dinner.
TODD: Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry.
ELAINE: Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
TODD: What?
ELAINE: I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
TODD: Elaine that was a legitimate bet and I lost so I bought you dinner.
ELAINE: Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
TODD: Hey, if your not doing anything Saturday do you want to meet somewhere?
ELAINE: See what is that? Is that a date?
TODD: Why can't two people go and do something without it being a date?
ELAINE: All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
TODD: No way. So I'll see you Saturday night?
ELAINE: All right.
TODD: Pick you up at 8:00 p.m.
[Jerry and Nikki getting pulled over by a cop]
POLICE OFFICER: Do you know what the posted speed limit on this road is?
JERRY: I was got to be 55.
POLICE OFFICER: That's right it is. Do you know how fast you were going?
JERRY: A lot faster than that!
POLICE OFFICER: Step out of the car sir.
JERRY: Okay dokey
POLICE OFFICER: Can I have your license and registration please?
JERRY: Absolutely. Nikki!
NIKKI: Yes.
JERRY: Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
NIKKI: Not at all.
POLICE OFFICER: I got you on the radar at 93 miles per hour.
JERRY: You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
NIKKI: Officer. Hi. Do you really have to give us a ticket?
JERRY: All right Nik. That's it.
[Kramer and Jerry at his apartment]
KRAMER: Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
JERRY: You got your shirt in my oven!?!
KRAMER: I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
JERRY: For both of us.
KRAMER: And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
JERRY: What's wrong with your oven?
KRAMER: I am baking a pie!
(Buzz, buzz)
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: Come on up.
KRAMER: You got cigars, huh.
JERRY: I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
KRAMER: Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
JERRY: Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
KRAMER: You got ripped buddy.
JERRY: I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
KRAMER: That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
(Kramer leaves)
GEORGE: Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
JERRY: so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
GEORGE: What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
JERRY: Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
GEORGE: Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
JERRY: No. I never had a job.
(Kramer walks in with no pants on)
KRAMER: I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
GEORGE: What the hell is this?
JERRY: Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
GEORGE: There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
KRAMER: Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
GEORGE: Yeah. You've heard of it?
KRAMER: Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
GEORGE: I'll see you guys later.
JERRY: What kind of pie are you cooking?
KRAMER: Huckleberry.
[George at Newman's apartment]
NEWMAN: You certainly are in a bind.
GEORGE: Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
NEWMAN: Oh well. Let me perfectly blunt. I don't care for you Costanza. You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just it up wasting your lives.
GEORGE: Are you going to help me or not?
NEWMAN: All right, all right. I'll help you but I will except something in return.
GEORGE: What?
NEWMAN: Well for starters I want a calzone of my own.....
GEORGE: All right.
NEWMAN: And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a week I will require a canolie.
GEORGE: That's a little steep don't you think?
NEWMAN: You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic. I would hate to see him when he's hungry.
GEORGE: All right, all right.
NEWMAN: Do we have a deal?
GEORGE: But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
NEWMAN: I know exactly how he feels. Pleasure doing business with you. Do come again. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[Todd and Elaine at a restaurant]
ELAINE: This is nice.
TODD: Gack. Party of four.
ELAINE: Party of four? Who are we meeting?
TODD: Mom! Dad! This is Elaine.
MOM: Hello.
ELAINE: Hellllllooooo.
(End of dinner)
MOM: Nice meeting you.
TODD: Bye mom.
MOM: She's wonderful.
ELAINE: What the hell was that?
TODD: What?
ELAINE: Why did you introduce me to your parents?
TODD: There nice people. I thought you would like them.
ELAINE: Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
TODD: Why is this a date?
ELAINE: Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
TODD: Elaine. I don't understand why you can't meet someone else's parents without classifying it as a date.
ELAINE: Well if it's not a date then what is it?
TODD: It's a lovely evening together.
ELAINE: I don't believe this.
TODD: Well I am getting a cab want to join me?
ELAINE: No. I'll just walk home.
TODD: Okay goodnight. (goes to kiss her)
ELAINE: Now what was that?
[George at Newman's apartment]
(Knock, knock)
NEWMAN: Hello. What 's this?
GEORGE: Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
NEWMAN: Work? It's raining.
GEORGE: Soooooo
NEWMAN: I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.
GEORGE: You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
NEWMAN: I was never that big on creeds.
GEORGE: You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
NEWMAN: I believe the deal was that I get the calzones on my mail route. Well today I won't be going on my mail route! Will I. Perhaps tomorrow.
GEORGE: But I'm paying you!
NEWMAN: Yes thank you. (slams door)
GEORGE: Newman!!
[Nikki and Jerry at his apartment]
NIKKI: Peru? I thought you wanted cigars from Cuba?
JERRY: I did.
NIKKI: Well if these aren't what you wanted then why did you pay him?
JERRY: Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
NIKKI: Okay.
[George at Kramer's apartment]
(Knock, knock)
GEORGE: Kramer!
KRAMER: Hey you!
GEORGE: Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
KRAMER: What happened to Newman?
GEORGE: He called in sick.
KRAMER: Oh yeah right it's raining.
GEORGE: Can you do it?
KRAMER: What time do you need it at?
GEORGE: 1:00 p.m. Do you need any money?
KRAMER: No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
[Kramer on street]
KRAMER: Hey hold that bus!
[Kramer at Pisano's]
KRAMER: Hey. It's really wet out there.
WORKER: What can I get you?
KRAMER: I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
WORKER: Calzone!
KRAMER: Yeah calzone.
WORKER: The best!
KRAMER: All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
WORKER: Three calzones.
KRAMER: Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
[Elaine goes to the coffee shop]
ELAINE: Hey Todd.
TODD: Hi. You know Nikki.
ELAINE: Yeah sure.
NIKKI: Wait. Elaine will settle this. What's the"M"stand for in Richard M. Nixon?
ELAINE: Milhouse.
NIKKI: I told you so. He said it was Moe. You owe me a dinner.
[Kramer at Pisano's]
WORKER: Your order is ready. Three calzones and one shirt and jacket.
KRAMER: Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
WORKER: What the hell do I know about cooking a shirt? What the hell is this? Your paying in pennies?
KRAMER: That's all I got.
WORKER: No. You have to have bills. Paper money. You can't pay with this.
KRAMER: I told you this is all I got.
WORKER: Then no calzones.
(Worker and Kramer yelling at each other back and forth in Italian)
[George's office at Yankee Stadium]
GEORGE: What happened? Where have you been?
KRAMER: The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
GEORGE: What the hell happened to your shirt?
KRAMER: He overcooked it. It's ruined.
GEORGE: Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
[Mr. Steinbrenner at his office]
MR. STEINBRENNER: (on phone) That's right. Do you want to say it again. I'll say it again. I hadn't had a pimple since I was eighteen and I don't care that you don't believe me or not. And how's this. Your fired. Okay your not. I am just a little hungry. Where's Costanza with my calzone. It's 1:15. He's late. That smell. I have to call you back. Costanza. He's in the building. Costanza is in the building and he's not in this office. Costanza! I'll get you.
[Jerry and Elaine at apartment]
JERRY: Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
ELAINE: These are terrible.
JERRY: It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
ELAINE: What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
JERRY: I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
ELAINE: Where are you going?
JERRY: I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
ELAINE: But she broke up with you.
JERRY: I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
ELAINE: It smells like a rubber fire.
JERRY:What's that?
ELAINE: I said rubber fire.
JERRY: Oh.
ELAINE: Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
JERRY: Actually it's being taken care of right now.
[Kramer at Todd's apartment]
(Knock, knock)
KRAMER: You Gack?
TODD: Yeah.
KRAMER: Here's your money.
(Kramer throws a bag full of change at him)
[Mr. Steinbrenner in George's office]
MR. STEINBRENNER: George. Why do these clothes smell like Pisano's?
GEORGE: Because they were heated up there.
MR. STEINBRENNER: Heating up your clothes? That's not a bad idea.
[Opening Monologue]
I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness, they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe. You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat, The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed. (as concerned car owner) 'Can I see it?' (as doctor-like mechanic) 'You better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight. We wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna keep the bill running up.'
[Yankee Stadium]
(Mr Wilhelm is hurrying along a corridor, with George trailing in his wake. As Wilhelm speaks, George is making notes onto a pad and looking flustered.)
WILHELM: And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for the cigarettes and the dive checks.
GEORGE: Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
WILHELM: The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat myself.
GEORGE: Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
WILHELM: Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here George. You've got to pay attention.
GEORGE: I know, sir. It won't happen again.
WILHELM: Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
(Wilhelm wanders across the corridor, thinking to himself, he opens the door to the men's room and strolls through.)
WILHELM: Lemme think here.
(George starts to follow Wilhelm into the men's room, but thinks better of it. He wonders briefly what to do, then leans against the wall by the door, to await Wilhelm's return.)
[Elaine's Office]
(Elaine sits behind her desk working at her computer. Mr Peterman enters. He's carrying an auction house catalogue.)
PETERMAN: Elaine.
ELAINE: Hi, Mr Peterman.
PETERMAN: You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.
ELAINE: I do.
PETERMAN: It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.
ELAINE: The pygmy pullover.
PETERMAN: Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.
ELAINE: Whatever.
PETERMAN: But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend and therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in my stead.
ELAINE: Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
PETERMAN: I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
(He drops the catalogue on the surprised Elaine's desk and exits.)
ELAINE: Wow.
[Yankee Stadium]
(George still waits outside the men's room. He's been waiting a while. He looks at his watch and decides to go in. As he enters, he finds Wilhelm emerging from a stall, and still talking.)
WILHELM: ...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
(Wilhelm washes his hands, while George looks panicky and opts to bluff it out.)
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
WILHELM: (drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I want you to make this project a top priority.
GEORGE: I will, sir. Top priority.
WILHELM: (exiting) Top priority.
GEORGE: Top priority.
(George throws up his arms in despair.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry and George stand. George is explaining what happened.)
GEORGE: So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
JERRY: He pulled an LBJ on you.
GEORGE: LBJ?
JERRY: Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
GEORGE: No kidding?
JERRY: Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
GEORGE: Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
JERRY: Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
GEORGE: I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
JERRY: You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
GEORGE: Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
(The door opens and Kramer enters, followed by Newman. Kramer is carrying a large can of some foodstuff, from which he is eating the odd morsel. Newman has a pack of soda (mellow yellow?), and is swigging from one of the bottles.)
KRAMER: Hey buddy.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Can I have my keys...
KRAMER: (tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
JERRY: (catching keys) ...back, please?
KRAMER: You shoulda come, Jerry.
NEWMAN: We made quite a haul.
GEORGE: Where'd you go?
KRAMER: Price club.
GEORGE: Why didn't you take your car?
KRAMER: Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
(Newman finishes his soda and drops the bottle in Jerry's bin.)
KRAMER: What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
NEWMAN: Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling thing.
KRAMER: You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
NEWMAN: (taking bottle) Refund?
KRAMER: Yes.
JERRY: Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
NEWMAN: I don't know, they're deranged.
(Kramer and Newman sit on Jerry's couch. Kramer has TV Guide, Newman still reading the bottle.)
GEORGE: Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
JERRY: No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
GEORGE: Awright, I'll see you later.
(George leaves. Jerry exits to the bedroom.)
NEWMAN: (peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?
KRAMER: That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
NEWMAN: Ten cents!?
KRAMER: Yeah.
NEWMAN: Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the difference.
KRAMER: No, it doesn't work.
NEWMAN: What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles together...
KRAMER: Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
JERRY: (re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
KRAMER: No, no, I'm off that.
NEWMAN: You tried it?
KRAMER: Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
JERRY: (leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
NEWMAN/KRAMER: (simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
(Jerry exits, shaking his head.)
[Sotheby's]
(An auction room, with several rows of seating facing a platform with a lectern for the auctioneer. Many people sit or stand around, with catalogues and numbered paddles for making bids. Jerry and Elaine enter.)
JERRY: Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
ELAINE: No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
JERRY: Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
(Sue Ellen notices them, and comes over.)
SUE ELLEN: Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.
ELAINE: Hi Sue Ellen.
JERRY: Hi Sue Ellen.
SUE ELLEN: I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of high society?
ELAINE: (faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
JERRY: I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
SUE ELLEN: Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
(Sue Ellen walks away to her seat. Elaine and Jerry make their way to their seats,)
ELAINE: (half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer and Newman are still on Jerry's couch. Kramer is watching TV, While Newman has been working something out on a pad.)
NEWMAN: I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?
KRAMER: No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
NEWMAN: I wanna learn. I want to know why.
[Sotheby's]
(A bag of golf clubs is brought onto the platform.)
ELAINE: (loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
AUCTIONEER: Lot number seven forty-five. We have a full set of golf clubs, that were owned by President John F Kennedy, as seen in the famous photograph of the president chipping at Burning Tree on the morning of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The set in perfect condition, and we will start the bidding at four thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars? Do I have four thousand dollars?
(A man behind Elaine raises his paddle to bid.)
AUCTIONEER: I have four thousand dollars. Do I have five? (another person bids) Five thousand dollars. I have five thousand dollars. Do I have six? Six thousand dollars for this set of beautiful clubs. (another bid) Six. I have six thousand dollars. Can I have sixty-five hundred?
(Elaine raises her paddle to bid.)
AUCTIONEER: Sixty-five hundred to the dark-haired person on the right. We are at sixty-five hundred, do I hear sixty-six hundred?
(Sue-Ellen looks thoughtful.)
AUCTIONEER: The president's own golf clubs. Leisure life at Camelot. Sixty-five hundred going once...
(Jerry and Elaine think they've got them.)
SUE ELLEN: Eight thousand.
AUCTIONEER: Eight thousand. We have eight thousand. The bid is now eight thousand dollars.
ELAINE: (to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
AUCTIONEER: We have eighty-five...
SUE ELLEN: Nine thousand.
AUCTIONEER: Nine thousand dollars.
JERRY: Think she wants those clubs.
AUCTIONEER: Do I hear ninety-five? Ninety-five hundred...
ELAINE: Ninety-five hundred.
SUE ELLEN: Ten thousand.
AUCTIONEER: Ten thousand, to the shapely woman on the left. Ten thousand going once...
JERRY: Well, that's your ceiling.
AUCTIONEER: Ten thousand going twice...
(Sue Ellen looks over at Elaine, with a smirk.)
ELAINE: (determined) Eleven thousand!
SUE ELLEN: Twelve thousand.
ELAINE: (angrier) Thirteen thousand!
SUE ELLEN: Fourteen thousand.
ELAINE: (vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
(Jerry buries his face in his hands.)
[Jerry's Car]
(Jerry is driving Elaine home. In the back seat, the golf clubs can be seen. There is a persistent clunking sound coming from the car.)
ELAINE: Peterman is gonna kill me.
JERRY: I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
ELAINE: Why didn't you stop me?
JERRY: Do you hear this clunking?
ELAINE: (listening) A little.
[Jerry's Car, later]
(The Saab halts outside Elaine's apartment building.)
ELAINE: Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
JERRY: Okay.
ELAINE: Alrighty, bye.
JERRY: Bye.
(Elaine leaves the car and walks away. Jerry restarts the car, when he notices steam and smoke emerging from under the hood.)
JERRY: What's going on here?
(Jerry gets out of the car and runs to raise the hood.)
JERRY: Oh God!
(Jerry opens the hood of his car. As the smoke and steam clears, it becomes clear there are a variety of comestibles arranged on and around the engine compartment.)
JERRY: (angry) Oh, you idiots!
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer and Newman still occupy the couch.)
NEWMAN: So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and mean?
KRAMER: Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
JERRY: Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
KRAMER: (to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
NEWMAN: (to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.
JERRY: And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
KRAMER: We ran outta space.
JERRY: Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
KRAMER: Ah, Tony, he's good.
JERRY: Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
KRAMER: (offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
JERRY: No, thank you.
[Auto Shop]
(Jerry and Tony stand beside the Saab. Jerry looks worried and Tony is looking like he's in love with the car. He runs his hands over the roof and along the lines of the bodywork. Tony is a little intense.)
TONY: (lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.
JERRY: Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
(Tony isn't hearing Jerry. He climbs into the driver's seat and begins ferreting about.)
JERRY: There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
TONY: Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?
JERRY: No, I hadn't noticed.
TONY: (accusingly) Have you been picking at it?
JERRY: Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
TONY: (disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see.
JERRY: The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
TONY: You been rotating the tires?
JERRY: Try to.
TONY: (sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
[Elaine's Office]
PETERMAN: Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I authorised you to spend.
ELAINE: I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
PETERMAN: Well, where are they?
ELAINE: (ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
[George's Office]
(George stands, silently rehearsing his follow-up question. Wilhelm walks by the window, down the corridor. George takes the plunge.)
GEORGE: Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
WILHELM: (entering the office) Yes George.
GEORGE: Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
WILHELM: Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.
GEORGE: Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
WILHELM: (confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George.
GEORGE: Well, I was wondering...
WILHELM: You mean you haven't been to payroll?
GEORGE: Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
WILHELM: Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
(Wilhelm leaves.)
GEORGE: Payroll!!
(George grabs his jacket, races to the door, checks Wilhelm has gone, and darts off down the corridor.)
[Yankee Stadium: Payroll Office]
(A meek looking clerk sits behind a counter. George enters.)
GEORGE: Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
CLERK: Yes?
GEORGE: Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
CLERK: What project?
GEORGE: Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
CLERK: You're gonna have to fill me in.
GEORGE: You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
CLERK: (blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come back here.
GEORGE: Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
CLERK: Well, maybe I will.
GEORGE: (spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
CLERK: (on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh, there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
(George is leaning across the counter, trying to hear Wilhelm's side of the converstion.)
CLERK: (on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see. (listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank you.
(The clerk puts down the phone. George looks expectant.)
CLERK: (apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever you need, just uh, make yourself at home.
GEORGE: So he explained it all to you?
CLERK: Yes, he explained it all very clearly.
GEORGE: What'd he tell you?
CLERK: (upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to humiliate me about it, alright!
[Newman's Apartment}
(Newman sits on his couch. He's using an old mechanical adding machine and a pad to work on permutations for the 'Michigan deposit bottle scam'. There are spools of used paper from the adding machine all over the table and maps of the northeastern states of the US pinned up on the wall. He taps out a series of number, pulls the handle and reads the result, then looks at what he's written on his pad.)
NEWMAN: Damn!
(Frustrated, he sits back. He notices a framed photograph of his mother. A thought occurs.)
NEWMAN (V.O.): Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second. Mother's Day?!
(He starts typing figures into the adding machine rapidly. He mouths numbers to himself, shrugging as he makes estimates. When he finishes he tears the paper strip from the machine, compares it to figures on his pad.)
NEWMAN: (triumphant) Yessss!
(In celebration he swigs from a bottle of soda.)
NEWMAN: Ahaha!
[Hallway]
(Newman hurries up to Kramer's door and hammers on it with his fist. He waits a few seconds, then impatiently hammers again.)
NEWMAN: Come on Kramer!
(The door opens to reveal Kramer midway through a shave, holding a razor, with foam on his face.)
KRAMER: Wha...?
NEWMAN: It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
KRAMER: Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
NEWMAN: No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Sagenaw, Michigan.
KRAMER: (interested) Uh-huh.
NEWMAN: But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
KRAMER: (realisation) Mother's Day.
NEWMAN: The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
KRAMER: A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
NEWMAN: (excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
KRAMER: Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
NEWMAN: (triumph) Let the collecting begin!
(They embrace joyfully.)
[Montage of scenes]
(A woman puts a soda can on top of a mail box while she reaches into her bag for something to post. A hand reaches from behind the box, picks up the can and disappears back behind the box. The woman is flummoxed by the can's disappearance. Newman stands nonchalantly beside a dumpster with a plastic sack containing some bottles and cans. In the dumpster, Kramer roots about beneath the plastic and cardboard, before coming up and handing a bottle to Newman, who drops it into his sack. In Monk's, a waitress puts a tray of empty bottle onto a shelf behind Kramer, who's eating a meal. As she leaves, he reaches behind him, takes the tray and tips the bottles into another plastic sack. Newman stands in a doorway on the street. A homeless guy pushes a shopping cart full of bottles and cans past. Newman drops a few coins onto the sidewalk, attracting the attention of the homeless guy, who leaves his cart to retrieve the change. Newman darts from the doorway, grabs hold of the cart and races away down the street, leaving the homeless guy shaking a fist and yelling after him. Newman finishes a bottle of soda and hands the empty to Kramer, who hands another bottle to Newman. There's a long line of empty bottles already on the table and Newman's looking close to capacity. As Newman reluctantly begins to drink this latest one, Kramer opens another and taps him on the stomach, causing Newman to splutter and spray soda across the table. A cigar-smoking Kramer and a gleeful Newman, regard the back of a mail truck, filled with plastic sacks of bottles and cans. They slap palms and shake hands as Kramer pulls down the door and flips the handle closed.)
[Yankee Stadium: George's Office]
(George has his head down on his desk. Wilhelm walks jauntily along the corridor and enters the office.)
WILHELM: So...
(George snaps awake.)
WILHELM: ...did you go down to payroll?
GEORGE: (standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
WILHELM: (pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then, huh?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
WILHELM: Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.
GEORGE: (to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
WILHELM: Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown. Just like the song says.
GEORGE: The song?
WILHELM: There's your answer. Downtown.
(Wilhelm leaves.)
GEORGE: (thoughtful) Downtown.
[Monk's]
(George and Jerry in a booth.)
JERRY: The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY: You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
GEORGE: I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
JERRY: Okay, so how does it go?
GEORGE: 'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
JERRY: '... downtown.'
GEORGE: 'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
JERRY: '...downtown.'
GEORGE: Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
JERRY: Seven-eleven?
GEORGE: 'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
JERRY: No, that's midtown.
GEORGE: 'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
JERRY: '...down town.'
GEORGE: 'Things'll be great, when you're...'
JERRY: '...downtown.'
GEORGE: I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
JERRY: Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
GEORGE: You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
JERRY: How can you lose?
[Jerry's Apartment/Elaine's Office]
(Jerry enters. He goes to his answering machine and plays the messages.)
TONY (O.S.): Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta talk. You better come down, any time after four.
(Jerry looks less than happy at the prospect. The phone rings, and Jerry answers.)
JERRY: Hello.
ELAINE: Hi, it's me.
JERRY: Oh, hi.
ELAINE: Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
JERRY: Oh, you know what?
ELAINE: (worry) Oh no. What?
JERRY: Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
ELAINE: You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
JERRY: I forgot.
ELAINE: Oh, go down and get them.
JERRY: I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
ELAINE: Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
JERRY: No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
ELAINE: (resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
[Outside Auto Shop]
(Jerry looks a touch anxious as Tony approaches. Tony is still real intense.)
JERRY: Hey, Tony.
TONY: Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
JERRY: Sure.
TONY: I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those quicky lube places, isn't it?
JERRY: Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
TONY: Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component) See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket.
JERRY: I really wanna...
TONY: Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil changed every thousand miles.
JERRY: How much money is this gonna cost me?
TONY: (contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure. When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?
JERRY: The washer fluid is fine.
TONY: (angry) The washer fluid is not fine!
JERRY: Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
TONY: What d'you mean?
JERRY: Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
TONY: Well, the car's on a lift.
JERRY: Well, just get it down.
TONY: (subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll bring it around.
JERRY: Okay. Thank you, very much.
(Tony walks away into the auto shop. Elaine arrives.)
ELAINE: Hey. Where's the car?
JERRY: He's bringing it.
ELAINE: Good.
(There is the sound of a car starting up, then a squeal of tires and Jerry's Saab emerges from the auto shop at high speed. It passes Jerry and Elaine and Races away down the street. They stare open-mouthed after the car, and at each other in astonishment.)
[...
[Montage of snippets]
JERRY (V.O.): Last week on Seinfeld.
A sequence of clips from The Bottle Deposit (1) establishes the story
so far: Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George has been given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine outbids Sue-Ellen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs on behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer and Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry has to take it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When Jerry asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him.
[Outside Auto Shop]
(Jerry and Elaine are outside the autoshop. Jerry is on the payphone.)
JERRY: Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
ELAINE: So? What'd they say?
JERRY: They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
ELAINE: What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
JERRY: Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
ELAINE: What kind of maniac is this guy?
JERRY: He's a very special maniac.
ELAINE: What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
JERRY: I don't know.
ELAINE: Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
[Elaine's Office]
(Elaine at her desk. Peterman enters.)
PETERMAN: Well, are they here?
ELAINE: Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
PETERMAN: Snag?
ELAINE: It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
PETERMAN: What does that have to do with my clubs?
ELAINE: They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is talking with a police detective at his door.)
DETECTIVE: What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?
JERRY: You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
DETECTIVE: All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?
JERRY: Had I been taking...?
DETECTIVE: Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.
JERRY: W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
(The detective stares at Jerry.)
JERRY: Not that I would think of doing such things.
DETECTIVE: (making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well.
JERRY: Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
[Yankee Stadium: George's Office]
(George sits at his desk, his forehead resting on a folder he has clutched in his hands. Mr Wilhelm enters, looking happy.)
GEORGE: (hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
WILHELM: That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. (shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.
GEORGE: I did?
WILHELM: Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work George.
(Wilhelm leaves. George looks stunned and confused.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(By now, George is looking much more pleased.)
JERRY: I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
GEORGE: Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
[Mr Wilhelm's Home]
(Wilhelm sits on the couch. He has a newspaper and is talking to his wife, who's in another room.)
WILHELM: The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't he dear?
MRS WILHELM (O.C.): You planted the rose bushes, dear.
WILHELM: I did?
MRS WILHELM (O.C.): Yesterday. You remember.
WILHELM: (thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?
MRS WILHELM (O.C.): We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?
(Wilhelm can be seen struggling to recollect.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(A still pleased looking George is fetching a drink from Jerry's fridge.)
GEORGE: The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
JERRY: No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
GEORGE: Why not?
JERRY: They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
(The door opens and Elaine enters.)
ELAINE: (to George) Hey.
GEORGE: Hey.
ELAINE: (to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
JERRY: They're looking.
GEORGE: I gotta go.
(George leaves. The phone rings and Jerry picks up.)
JERRY: Y'hello.
DETECTIVE (V.O.): Mr Seinfeld?
JERRY: Yeah.
DETECTIVE (V.O.): It's Detective McMahon...
(Elaine looks quizzical. Jerry mouths, 'It's the police')
DETECTIVE (V.O.): ...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd better get down here.
JERRY: Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
ELAINE: (makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
JERRY: Are there golf clubs in the back?
DETECTIVE (V.O.): We really can't tell. You better bring your service records.
[Pier 38 Warehouse]
(The interior of the warehouse is gloomy and dank. There are cars and parts of cars arranged round the area, together with tools, welding gear, etc. Detective McMahon stands beside a car-shaped object hidden under a white sheet. Jerry and Elaine are led in by a young patrolman who looks queasy.)
YOUNG COP: Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.
DETECTIVE: How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.
JERRY: (indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
ELAINE: (explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
DETECTIVE: I see.
JERRY: Yeah.
DETECTIVE: I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make sure.
JERRY: Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
DETECTIVE: One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.
(He lifts the sheet, revealing what's beneath to Jerry and Elaine.)
ELAINE: (horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
JERRY: Oh my God!
(The young patrolman removes his cap out of respect for the victim.)
DETECTIVE: The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.
ELAINE: Oh, my God.
DETECTIVE: And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is all burnt out.
JERRY: What is that smell?
DETECTIVE: Look at the clutch.
(They look. Jerry and Elaine don't like what they see.)
ELAINE: Uuh.
(The patrolman cracks and leaves hurriedly, looking nauseous.)
YOUNG COP: Excuse me.
DETECTIVE: Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe.
ELAINE: Uhh
JERRY: Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
DETECTIVE: Your car's not a turbo?
JERRY: No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
ELAINE: (sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
(Elaine and Jerry hug in happiness. In the background, another woman arrives.)
WOMAN: Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... (voice breaking) midnight blue?
DETECTIVE: (condolences) Yes ma'am.
[Mail Truck]
(Newman drives as he and Kramer give voice to their happiness.)
KRAMER/NEWMAN: (singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
(Their singing ends shambolically as they lose track of the lyrics. But the pair still look gleeful.)
[Jerry's Apartment/Jerry's car]
(The phone rings in Jerry's apartment. He picks it up.)
JERRY: Hello.
TONY: Hey Jerry, it's Tony.
JERRY: Tony, where are you?
(The Saab is driving down a quiet country road at night.)
TONY: Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.
(Tony holds the phone toward the dash and revs the engine a little. Jerry can hear the engine noise over the phone.)
JERRY: Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
TONY: (angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from me, I don't forget that.
JERRY: Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
TONY: Oh, your car. You want your car back!
JERRY: Tony.
TONY: Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.
(Tony hangs up the phone.)
JERRY: (exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
[Mail Truck]
(Kramer is driving the truck along a highway in daylight.)
NEWMAN: How much gas we got?
KRAMER: Three quarters of a tank.
(Newman punches the numbers into a calculator.)
KRAMER: That's better than we estimated.
NEWMAN: (smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
(They give a smug little laugh.)
NEWMAN: Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.
KRAMER: Ah, no, that's not in the budget.
NEWMAN: Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a good investment.
KRAMER: That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
(A convertible black Saab passes the mail truck.)
KRAMER: Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
(He accelerates the mail truck to close on the Saab, and leans forward, straining to make out the plate.)
KRAMER: Yeah, those are New York plates.
NEWMAN: Is that Jerry's number?
KRAMER: I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
(Kramer reaches under his seat, rummaging for something.)
NEWMAN: What're you doing?
KRAMER: I'm calling Jerry.
NEWMAN: On what?
KRAMER: Brought my phone.
(He pulls out his mobile and hits the speed dial for Jerry.)
[Jerry's Apartment/Mail Truck]
JERRY: (answering phone) Y'hello.
KRAMER: Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
JERRY: Why, what's up?
KRAMER: Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
JERRY: Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
KRAMER: (checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
JERRY: Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
KRAMER: Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
JERRY: Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
KRAMER: Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
[Elaine's Office/Jerry's Apartment]
(The phone rings in Elaine's office. She answers it.)
ELAINE: Elaine Benes.
JERRY: Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
ELAINE: Oh my god, where is it?
JERRY: It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
ELAINE: Are the clubs there?
JERRY: I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
ELAINE: Alright, I'm heading over right now.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Elaine enters at a rush.)
ELAINE: What's the status?
JERRY: Last check-in, they were still on him.
ELAINE: Well, have they called the police yet?
JERRY: No, they won't call the police.
ELAINE: What? Why not?
JERRY: They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
ELAINE: Kramer has a record.
JERRY: Not a Federal record.
(The phone rings. Jerry grabs the handset by the couch, Elaine picks up in the kitchen.)
[Mail Truck/Jerry's Apartment]
ELAINE/JERRY: Kramer?
JERRY: What's going on?
KRAMER: Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
(Ahead of the truck, the black Saab indicates his intention to move onto the off-ramp.)
KRAMER: Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
ELAINE: Keep following him.
KRAMER: Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
NEWMAN: Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.
KRAMER: Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
ELAINE: I need those clubs.
JERRY: Kramer, I want my car.
KRAMER: Well, I don't know what to do.
NEWMAN: Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy could be going to Arkansas.
JERRY: Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
NEWMAN: Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our budget won't hold it.
KRAMER: Well, I don't know what to do man!
NEWMAN: Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.
ELAINE/JERRY: Right. Go right!/South!
KRAMER: Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
(Kramer swerves onto the off-ramp at the last moment. Tyres squeal and the truck sways.)
[Mail Truck]
NEWMAN: I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole venture.
KRAMER: This ramp is steep.
NEWMAN: All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.
KRAMER: Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
(Newman reaches across and takes the steering wheel as Kramer gets out of the driving seat.)
NEWMAN: What're you doing?
KRAMER: (climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
NEWMAN: Are you crazy?
(The truck swerves as Newman slides into the driving seat.)
KRAMER: Keep your foot on the gas.
(Kramer shoves his way through the sackloads of bottles and cans.)
NEWMAN: Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
(Kramer slides open the rear door of the truck.)
NEWMAN: Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our losses.
(Kramer grabs a sack and heaves it out the back of the truck.)
KRAMER: Look out below!!
(Car horns can be heard as the sack lands in the carriageway. Kramer grabs another sack and hurls that out, with another yelled warning.)
[Yankee Stadium: Steinbrenner's Office]
(Steinbrenner sits behind his desk. He's examining something on his desktop with a large powerful magnifying glass.)
STEINBRENNER: (to himself) With this magnifying glass, I feel like a scientist.
(There is a tap at the door, and George cautiously enters.)
GEORGE: You wanted to see me, sir?
STEINBRENNER: Ah, come in George, come in.
(George strolls up to Big Stein's desk, looking more confident.)
STEINBRENNER: Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on.
GEORGE: (smiling) Yes sir.
STEINBRENNER: Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?
GEORGE: (wondering where this is leading) No sir.
STEINBRENNER: What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? You on the pipe?
GEORGE: (worried now) No sir.
STEINBRENNER: Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry!
GEORGE: What're.. What're you talking about?
STEINBRENNER: George, I've read this report. It's very troubling, very troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here.
(Two burly guys who are clearly medical orderlies come into the room behind George.)
STEINBRENNER: Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb and Dan.
(George regards the two guys, very nervously as they approach him and stand behind him, one on either shoulder.)
STEINBRENNER: They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.
(Herb and Dan take hold of George's arms. George gets panicky)
GEORGE: Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
(Herb and Dan begin to drag the struggling George across the office toward the door.)
STEINBRENNER: Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write it.
GEORGE: I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
(As Herb and Dan haul George through the door, George makes his last stand, trying to get a hold on the doorframe with his feet. Eventually he is dragged out into the corridor and vanishes from view.)
STEINBRENNER: Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the time, I understand. (as George disappears) Don't worry, your job'll be waiting for you when you get back. (banging his fist on his desk) Get better George. Get better!
[Mail Truck]
(The Saab travels down a quiet country road at night, followed by the mail truck. Kramer is driving, Newman looks furious in the passenger seat.)
KRAMER: (frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
(He looks across at the substantial bulk of Newman and a thought occurs.)
KRAMER: ...sluggish.
NEWMAN: I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.
KRAMER: Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
NEWMAN: (perks up) A pie stand? Where?
KRAMER: Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
NEWMAN: Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
(Kramer pulls the truck into the roadside. As it halts, Newman sticks his head out the window to peer back down the road.)
NEWMAN: Where? I..I..I don't see it.
KRAMER: Well open the door, you get a better look.
(Newman slides back the door and leans out.)
NEWMAN: I don't see any pie...
(Kramer plants his foot firmly in Newman's backside and heaves him out of the truck.)
NEWMAN: ...Aargh!
(As Newman lands heavily in the verge, Kramer slides the door shut and drives away.)
NEWMAN: Kramer!!
KRAMER: I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
NEWMAN: (after speeding truck) Kramer!!
(In the mail truck, Kramer picks up his phone and redials.)
KRAMER: (shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
[Country Roadside]
(Newman wanders forlornly along the roadside at night. He tries to thumb a ride from passing traffic, displaying his uniform insignia to drivers.)
NEWMAN: Federal employee. Federal employee.
(Aside from a few blaring car horns, he gets no response. He continues his trudge, a sour look on his face.)
[Countryside]
(Newman struggles up a steep slope. Newman pushes his way through a field of crops. He emerges from the vegetation and sees a farmhouse, its lights blazing. His face lights up. He stumbles towards the welcoming lights, tripping and falling, before picking himself up and running up to the building.)
[Farm]
(Newman reaches the steps to the porch and stumbles up them. As he reaches the door, a scent catches his attention. Looking to the window, he sees a pie left out on the window sill to cool. A craftier look comes to his face. He turns back to the door and knocks. After a few seconds, it opens.)
FARMER: Hello stranger.
NEWMAN: (a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.
FARMER: Calm down, now. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
NEWMAN: Oh, thank you, sir.
FARMER: Just have one rule. Keep your hands off my daughter.
(Just then, the daughter in question slinks up behind the farmer. Blonde, twenty-ish, just one walking temptation.)
[Mail Truck/Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer has the mail truck right behind Jerry's Saab as they race along a quiet country road.)
KRAMER: Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
(Jerry and Elaine are sitting on the couch, each with a phone handset.)
JERRY: How's the gas situation?
KRAMER: (checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
(In front of him, Tony reaches into the back seat of the Saab.)
KRAMER: He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
(Tony extracts a long, metallic object from behind himself.)
KRAMER: He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
JERRY: Duck, Kramer! Duck!
(Kramer crouches as far as he can. Tony flings the object at Kramer's mail truck. It crashes against the windshield and bounces away.)
KRAMER: It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
ELAINE: Those are JFK's golf clubs!
(Tony hurls another club at the mail truck. Again, it bounces off the windshield, leaving some cracks.)
KRAMER: Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
ELAINE: Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
JERRY: No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
KRAMER: Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
(Tony flings a heavy wood at the truck.)
KRAMER: (noise)
(The Saab leads the truck down the road, with Tony hurling club after club over his shoulder and into the front of the truck.)
KRAMER: (yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
(Tony hurls the golf bag at the truck. It slams solidly against the windshield, Kramer flinches, the truck swerves. The front wheel runs over a club on the tarmac and the tyre bursts.)
JERRY: (hearing the noises) What's happening!
(The truck is rattling and lurching as it struggles along the road.)
KRAMER: This truck is dying. We're losing him.
(The Saab easily outpaces the truck and accelerates away. The truck staggers to a halt, giving out a death rattle. A cloud of steam and smoke erupts from under the hood.)
KRAMER: I think we lost him.
JERRY: (disappointment) Dammit!
ELAINE: (quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
KRAMER: (subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
(Jerry hangs up.)
[Country]
(Kramer climbs out of the truck and looks back down the road. He kicks the deflated tyre. Coming to the front of the truck, he picks a club off the front bumper and pulls the broken shaft of another out of the radiator grille. Kramer walks along the road with the bent and broken clubs. He comes upon the bag and transfers the clubs into it. Slinging it over his shoulder, he continues on his way, picking up more battered golf clubs as he goes.)
[Farm]
(Newman, the farmer and the farmer's daughter sit round the kitchen table. They are working their way through a generous meal.)
FARMER: Enjoy that mutton?
NEWMAN: (mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
(The farmer's daughter is staring at Newman and toying with her fork, touching it to her lips and teeth. (It's difficult to be arousing with cutlery, but she's giving it a pretty good shot.) Newman notices this and tries to take a nonchalant sip from a glass, but it goes down the wrong way and he splutters.)
FARMER: That cider too strong for you?
NEWMAN: No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
(The farmer's daughter licks her lips.)
FARMER: Gonna be milking Holsteins in the morning, if you'd like to lend a hand.
NEWMAN: (reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.
FARMER: Ahh, Susie here'll teach you.
(The farmer's daughter goes wide eyed.)
FARMER: Just gotta pull on the teat a little.
(Susie and Newman half-laugh nervously.)
SUSIE: (suggestive) Nice having a big, strong, man around.
NEWMAN: You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
(The farmer looks at him oddly.)
NEWMAN: (breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
[Institution]
(George is using a payphone in the corner of the room. His free hand is holding the waistband of his trousers. In the background are a couple of inmates and visitors, and an orderly. Notable among them are Pop and Deena Lazzari, previously seen in 'The Gum'.)
GEORGE: (desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
DEENA: I'll be back same time next week, Pop.
GEORGE: (quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
(Deena spots George as she makes her way out of the room.)
DEENA: George?
(George looks like his salvation has arrived. He hangs up the phone.)
DEENA: I see you're finally getting some help.
GEORGE: Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
DEENA: George, this is the best thing for you. (she walks away)
GEORGE: Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
(As he tries to follow Deena, the orderly grabs hold of him and restrains him.)
GEORGE: Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
(George is almost in tears and hops from foot to foot in frustration as the orderly holds him. Pop Lazzari wanders over.)
POP: Is that little Georgie C? How's the folks? You still got that nice little car?
[Countryside]
(Kramer approaches a familiar farmhouse. As he mounts the steps up to the porch, a commotion erupts inside the place. A gunshot rings out and the farmer's daughter screams. Kramer flinches. The farmer can be heard yelling angrily. The door is flung open and Newman runs out pulling up his trousers.)
NEWMAN: (screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!
KRAMER: What you doing?!
NEWMAN: (pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
(Newman sets off running. From the door of the farmhouse comes the farmer, armed with a shotgun, closely followed by his daughter, whose shirt is undone and hair is dishevelled.)
KRAMER: (takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
FARMER: (taking aim) I told you to keep away from my daughter!
(As Kramer and Newman reach the edge of the crops, the farmer fires a shot. Both Newman and Kramer leap in the air and run into the cover of the crop. Before the farmer can fire again, his daughter pushes the barrel of the shotgun downward, spoiling his aim.)
SUSIE: No daddy, you'll hurt him! I love him! (waving after Newman) Goodbye Norman, goodbye.
[Elaine's Office]
(Elaine is sitting with her head in her hands. Peterman enters at a rush.)
PETERMAN: (excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. Where are they?
ELAINE: (not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
PETERMAN: Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only by her proclivity to procreate.
(Elaine puts the bag of clubs down beside Peterman. The clubs are, of course, wrecked. Elaine looks like she's expecting a poor reaction. Peterman picks up a club or two, staring in disbelief at the twisted metal.)
ELAINE: The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
PETERMAN: Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.
ELAINE: (spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
PETERMAN: See you on Monday.
(Peterman picks up the bag and heads for the door.)
ELAINE: Have a good game.
[Opening Monologue]
The whole concept of being separated to me is strange, it's like you're engaged to be divorced. We're gonna try making not being together work. First we we're separated, then we met, then we were together, now we are gonna try being separated again. We actually think some kind of giant rubber band might be the best solution. 'Course when you were a kid in school you would get separated for having too good of a time, 'if you too kids don't stop laughing and having fun i'm gonna have to separate you' Then the kid finds out his parents are breaking up and he thinks it's because they got caught fooling around, which is probably true.
[Setting: The Coffee Shop]
(Elaine and Jerry are sitting across from each other in a booth)
JERRY: Hairdo?
ELAINE: (Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
JERRY: You look like Brenda Starr.
ELAINE: Is that good?
JERRY: It's better than Dondi.
(Elaine laughs, then draws her attention to a table across the room)
ELAINE: Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
JERRY: (Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?
ELAINE: Mm-hmm.
JERRY: You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
ELAINE: Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
JERRY: Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
ELAINE: Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
(George enters, somewhat annoyed. He's gesturing to the parking lot)
GEORGE: This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
(Jerry moves over, making room for George to sit)
ELAINE: Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.
GEORGE: You have a car?
ELAINE: Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
JERRY: (Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
GEORGE: Me either.
(David and Beth Lookner, on their way out, approach the booth)
BETH: (Unsure as to whether it's him or not) Jerry? Elaine, Hi!
ELAINE: (Overly generous) Hi, David!
JERRY: Hi, Beth!
BETH: Oh, uh, George, (Introducing to two) this is my husband, David.
GEORGE: Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)
DAVID: Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the Yankees, right?
GEORGE: Yeah. Why, what do you do?
DAVID: Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.
GEORGE: Really?
BETH: Mm-hm.
DAVID: Yeah.
GEORGE: (Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
(George and Elaine both laugh out loud. Beth and David look at each other, taking in the awkward moment)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's in the kitchen. Kramer slides in, followed by Mickey. Mickey's reading a script)
KRAMER: Hey!
JERRY: Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?
MICKEY: I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's Studio tonight.
JERRY: Really?
KRAMER: It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
MICKEY: Kramer's going to be my scene partner.
JERRY: Kramer?
MICKEY: He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. I'm playing a detective.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
JERRY: Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
KRAMER: (Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
JERRY: (Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
KRAMER: (Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
JERRY: (Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
KRAMER: (Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
(Mickey visibly rolls his eyes)
JERRY: Ehh, I dunno..
KRAMER: Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
Kramer points a finger at him) Don't think I won't, Jerry!
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Elaine's car]
(Elaine is obviously an incredibly bad driver. Jerry, in the passenger's seat, looks car sick)
ELAINE: God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
(Looks ahead, then breaks suddenly) Woah..
JERRY: (His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
ELAINE: You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
MAN: Hey!
JERRY: (Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
(Elaine's expression changes as she's listening to her messages)
ELAINE: Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
JERRY: (Out of it) Huh?
ELAINE: They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Monk's coffee shop]
(Elaine and Jerry sitting across from each other in a booth)
ELAINE: So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
JERRY: I don't know, but we don't have much time.
ELAINE: (Agreeing) Mm.
JERRY: The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
ELAINE: Right.
JERRY: It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
ELAINE: Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
JERRY: Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
ELAINE: (Nodding) Yeah, yeah..
JERRY: But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
ELAINE: Then why are we calling?
JERRY: Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
(Both start chanting "why are we calling..", thinking deeply)
ELAINE: Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
JERRY: (Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
ELAINE: Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(George enters)
ELAINE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.

[Opening monologue]
I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to the men, we'd just drive around sticking flyers in windshields ...y' know... Not even typed up either, just Magic Marker, Zerox, you know...Party!!.. What's needed is a divorce announcement; Mr and Mrs Fred Johnson are requesting the honour of your presence at the "returning" of their daughter back to Mr,and Mrs Fred Johnson.
[Outside Melody Stationeries]
(Susan and George walk into the store and go up the sales clerk.)

GEORGE: (mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.
CLERK: When 's the wedding?
SUSAN: June
GEORGE: late June.
CLERK: Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder) They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.
(George takes the binder and feigns browsing and flips right to the last page.)
GEORGE: He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
CLERK: Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years. I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.
SUSAN: Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
GEORGE: What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.
SUSAN: Why don't they make'em anymore?
CLERK: Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.
GEORGE: So we pick up some (word missing)
SUSAN: (disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.

JERRY: why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
GEORGE: I can't
JERRY: Why not?
GEORGE 'Cause I can't face that scene. You know what kind of scene that would be? i'd rather be unhappy for the rest of my life than go through something like that. (forceful) I CAN'T, I CAN'T. I tried to psyche myself up a million times I cannot go through that.

JERRY: Aagh! You come back for your clothes
GEORGE: I'm not going back in there.
JERRY: So forget about your clothes.

ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
ELAINE: Yeah! You're probably right.
JERRY: Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
ELAINE: No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
JERRY: So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
ELAINE: Yep! just you and Kramer.
(Elaine walks away)
JERRY: See you ... me and Kramer...
(Daydreaming sequence set in Jerry's apt. in a probable future. Kramer pops in. They look a little older.)
KRAMER: Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
JERRY: (annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
KRAMER: Huh! You make a higher roof.
JERRY: They're not making higher roofs.
KRAMER: why can't you make a higher roof.
JERRY: Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
(As Jerry slowly comes out of his doze he is about to cross the street as a car comes to him at high speed.)
JERRY: .....Stupid , stupid.
JEANNIE: Hey! Hey! Look out. (she pulls him back saving his life.) OK!, Are you okay?
JERRY: Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
JEANNIE: Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.
JERRY: oh! thank you.
JEANNIE: You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die.. If that bothers you.
JERRY: Well I...
JEANNIE: You see..(points to his collar) To me this is a waste.
JERRY: What?
JEANNIE: The shirt you got on under your sweather. It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar.
JERRY: I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
JEANNIE: Jeannie Steinman.
JERRY: Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
JEANNIE: I like it.
[George and Susan at their apt.]
GEORGE: Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
SUSAN: No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
GEORGE: Why not?
SUSAN: He doesn't even know my name.
GEORGE: That was an honest mistake.
SUSAN: Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
(George takes out a pack of cigarettes and pulls one out.)
GEORGE: Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
SUSAN: Whadda doing?
GEORGE: (shrugs and lights it up)
SUSAN: Since when do you smoke?

SUSAN: I don't like this one bit.
GEORGE: Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...
SUSAN: Well you are gonna have to quit.
(George sprints to the bathroom)
GEORGE: Oh my god....
[At Monks.]
WAITRESS: Menus?
JERRY: No. I know what I want.
WAITRESS: The usual?
JERRY: Yeah.,
WAITRESS: And for you?
JEANNIE: I'll have a bowl of Cheerios , not to much milk.
WAITRESS: Ok Two bowls of Cheerios.
JEANNIE: You too.?...
JERRY: Yeah!!!
[At Jerry's. Kramer comes in Jerry is on the couch.]
KRAMER: Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
JERRY: Uh! Really .That's nice.
KRAMER: Now what's with you?
JERRY: I think I'm in love.
KRAMER: Oh. Come on.
JERRY: No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
KRAMER: If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
JERRY: No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
KRAMER: You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
[At the HOME FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK Kramer walks up to a teller.]
KRAMER: Hey!
TELLER: Hey!
KRAMER: Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
TELLER: Yes I did
KRAMER: No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
TELLER: No, No I said Hello.
KRAMER: No, No You said Hey!
TELLER: Well.. Hey! is Hello, same thing.
KRAMER: The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
TELLER: You're taking that much to literally. Now sir , do you have any business to transact.
KRAMER: No, I want to speak to the manager.
TELLER: Well, He's not here right now.
KRAMER: Then I'll be back.
[In Jerry's hallway]
ELAINE: So I'm not gonna be an usher?
GEORGE: No..
ELAINE: So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
GEORGE: Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
KRAMER: What are you talking about?
GEORGE: You've been demoted.
KRAMER: Why?
GEORGE: Because you called her by the wrong name.
KRAMER: But she really looks like a Lily
ELAINE: Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
KRAMER: Yeah. me neither.
JERRY: (shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
GEORGE: Who!!?
JERRY: I just met her, she's incredible.
ELAINE: Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
JERRY: You can go with Kramer
KRAMER: No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
GEORGE: Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
ELAINE: Did you try the cigarettes?
GEORGE: Yeah.. They made me sick.
KRAMER: All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
GEORGE: Yeah...
KRAMER: All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
GEORGE: What does that mean?
KRAMER: Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
GEORGE: What does that do?
KRAMER: Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
GEORGE: They are?... Elaine?
ELAINE: I wouldn't sign one.
GEORGE: Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....
KRAMER: Get out of here.
(George and Susan at their apt.)
GEORGE: Hi.
SUSAN: Hi. Hey I've been going over the list .What about The Drake? Wanna invite him?
GEORGE: Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something that's been on my mind and we haven't really talked about it..I t's kind of important to me.
SUSAN: What is it?
GEORGE: Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.
SUSAN: A pre-nup?
GEORGE: Yeah.
SUSAN: (burst out laughing)
GEORGE: What's so funny?
SUSAN: Ha.Ha.Ha. ha...You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. ha. ha. ha. Yeah.. give me the papers I'll sign 'em.( she leaves) a pre-nup...
[Scenes of Jerry and Jeannie enjoying each other in the park , at the grocery store, comparing comic books and making out. Interrupted by Kramer as he slams into Jerry's locked door.]
JERRY: Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
KRAMER: Jerry.... hey Jeannie.
JEANNIE: Hello.
KRAMER: Remember I told you about the bank?
JERRY: Yeah.
KRAMER: Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
JERRY: Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
JEANNIE: Yeah I think it's the same thing.
KRAMER: Oh! Big surprise ( he leaves frustrated)
[Scene takes us to George's again. We hear a buzzer.]
DELIVERY MAN: Delivery from Melody Stationaries.
SUSAN: Oh those are the invitations.
DELIVERY MAN: Just sign there.
SUSAN: yeah! Thank you.
GEORGE: See ya later.
SUSAN: Urgh.. these are so cheap. (as George leaves) And don't forget tommorrow we're going shopping for some rings, so don't make any plans...and this time we're not skimping.
[To Jerry's again]
KRAMER: Hey
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Jeannie left?
JERRY: Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
KRAMER: Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
JERRY: What's with you?
KRAMER: Nothin'
JERRY: Something on your mind?
KRAMER: No.
JERRY: Looks like there is?
KRAMER: No
JERRY: Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
KRAMER: I don't like her.
JERRY: You don't like her?
KRAMER: That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
JERRY: What's wrong with her?
KRAMER: Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
JERRY: Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
KRAMER: So THAT's how it's going to be
JERRY: That's how it's gonna be.
KRAMER: OH! GOD HELP US!!!
[George's Apartment. Susan licking envelopes]
SUSAN: Eurk.. Awful
[Jerry at the pier watching lovers and families considering his future]
[Another look at Susan licking her envelopes, getting nauseous.]
[Back to the Federal Home Savings Bank]
MANAGER: May i help you?
KRAMER: Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
MANAGER: Then you are entitled to a hundred dollars. That's our policy.

MANAGER: Yeah. pine's okay.
(Jim the teller walks over)
JIM: You want to see me
MANAGER: Yeah... Hum..Jim , a man here says came in the other day , you didn't say hello?
JIM: No, No that's not true, I said Hey! you know like a friendly greeting, Hey!
KRAMER: But that's not Hello.

KRAMER: Uhummm...
MANAGER: You know what, let me bring some other people in on this...Barbara, Jane, Mike Can I see you please.
BARBARA: How you doin'?
JANE: What's happening?
MIKE: What's up?
MANAGER: (to kramer) Can you excuse us for one minute. Just one minute.
(Kramer gets up a little confused and walks away.)
MANAGER: Thanks. (they huddle)
SOME GUY: How's it going?
MANAGER: Thanks, thanks everybody. (they leave) Sir, have a seat.
MANAGER: Well , we've discussed this, here's the feeling. You got a greeting starts with an H how's twenty bucks sound.
KRAMER: I'll take it.
MANAGER: awright sir (they shake hands)
[Scene cuts to the Improv as Jerry walks into the club and sees Jeannie sitting at a table]
JERRY: Will you marry me?
[Susan licks her last envelope and collapses. George is walking down a street looking depressed.]
[We go back to the Improv.]
JERRY: I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
JEANNIE: Georgie boy..
JERRY: George, big news; I'm getting married!!
GEORGE: Married , What!(astounded)
JERRY: September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
JEANNIE: ... all that crap.
JERRY: You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
GEORGE: Good for you (sympathetic)
JERRY: Hey look , Champagne..
GEORGE: Hehehe. .(feebly)
JERRY: To our future wives....yeah...
[George returns home only to find..... Scene then cuts to Monks with Jerry and Jeannie arriving.]
JERRY: Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
JEANNIE: Hey! what's the deal with decaf; how do they get the caffeine out of there and then where does it go?
JERRY: (weakly) I dunno
(A guy suddenly gets up to leave then falls on the ground.)
JEANNIE: That's a shame..
JERRY: (to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
JEANNIE: Bowl of Corn flakes.
JERRY: More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
JEANNIE: Hey! So what's the deal with brunch, I mean that if it's a combination of breakfast and lunch. How comes there's no lupper or no linner.
[Back to Jerry's, Kramer comes in..]
KRAMER: Hey!! Frank just called me. Congratulations.
JERRY: Thanks , thanks
KRAMER: Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
JERRY: Yeah , yeah .
KRAMER: C'mon , c'mon what's the matter?
JERRY: I think I may have made a big mistake.
KRAMER: Oh! Come on.
JERRY: All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
KRAMER: (mocking) Too bad you got engaged.
JERRY: Yeah! Too bad.
(Phone rings, Jerry picks it up.)
JERRY: Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
KRAMER: What happened?
JERRY: They just took Susan to the Hospital
[At the hospital.]
JERRY: So she was just lying there.
GEORGE: Tsss...Yeah..
ELAINE: I wonder what happened?
GEORGE: I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.
DOCTOR: Excuse me , Are you the husband?
GEORGE: Well , not yet.. Fiancé.
DOCTOR: Well , I'm sorry.....She's gone.
GEORGE: .........What's that?...
DOCTOR: She expired.
GEORGE: ...Are you sure?
DOCTOR: Yes , of course.
GEORGE: So.....She's dead?
DOCTOR: Yes
GEORGE: ...Huh!
DOCTOR: Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?
GEORGE: ...Why?
DOCTOR: We found traces of a certain toxic adhesive commonly found in very low priced envelopes.
GEORGE: Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.
DOCTOR: That's probably what did it.
GEORGE: We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
(Doctor leaves, George returns to the others)
GEORGE: She's ahem....gone
JERRY: Dead?
ELAINE: I'm so sorry George
JERRY: Yeah! me too
KRAMER: Poor Lily..
JERRY: How did it happen?
GEORGE: Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.
ALL: Aah!..
KRAMER: Well that's weird
JERRY: So I guess , you're not getting married?
GEORGE: (embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.
JERRY: But....
GEORGE: Yeah?
JERRY: Well , now I'm engaged..
GEORGE: Yeah?...
JERRY: Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
GEORGE: Hey!.. What can I tell ya.
ELAINE: All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
GEORGE: well humm.. lets get some coffee.
JERRY: WE HAD A PACT!!!
[George at home on the phone]
GEORGE: Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please? Marisa, Hi it's George Costanza.. I'm the short, funny, quirky bald man you met a little while ago, heh! yeah I was just calling 'cos I wanted you to know that I'm not engaged anymore......well huh, She died....Toxic glue from the wedding invitations.....well we were expecting about two hundred people. Yeah... Anyway.. hum I got the funeral tomorrow but huh.. my weekend is pretty wide open and I was wondering... (dial tone interrupts George)..... Hello...Hello..
[The cemetery. Jerry, George, and the Rosses are standing in front of Susan's tombstone, which reads "Susan Biddle Ross, June 8, 1964 - May 19, 1996."]
GEORGE: Well... it's a magnificent stone.
MR. ROSS: They put it up this morning.
(pause.)
GEORGE: It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
(Jerry, obviously uncomfortable, turns slowly and shrugs his shoulders at George.)
MRS. ROSS: George... we'll leave you alone with her.
GEORGE: What?
MRS. ROSS: I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
(She pats his shoulder, and then she and her husband leave Jerry and George alone with Susan.)
GEORGE: No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
(Jerry turns around to follow the Rosses.)
GEORGE: Jerry...
(He tries to keep Jerry there, but Jerry jerks away. George then turns to Susan's stone nervously, trying to think of where to begin. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ross offers Jerry an alcoholic beverage of some sort.)
JERRY: Thank you, no.
(She continues drinking.)
GEORGE: (to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
[Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: Boy, that was awkward!
JERRY: I don't mind the cemetery.
GEORGE: What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
JERRY: Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
GEORGE: What is that?
JERRY: Star Trek II.
GEORGE: (identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
JERRY: Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
GEORGE: That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
JERRY: Yeah...
(For a brief moment, the two become overwhelmed with emotion.)
GEORGE: Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
JERRY: So it's over?
GEORGE: I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
JERRY: All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
GEORGE: Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
(Kramer enters as George is leaving.)
KRAMER: Movie?
JERRY: Yeah, you in?
KRAMER: No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
GEORGE: George is going to the movies! (exits)
JERRY: (to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
KRAMER: (pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
JERRY: ...But with punching and kicking.
KRAMER: Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
JERRY: Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
KRAMER: What, she's been away?
JERRY: She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
KRAMER: No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
JERRY: That was July 4th!
(Kramer pauses to think.)
JERRY: Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
[The coffee shop]
ELAINE: It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
JERRY: Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
ELAINE: Oh, tons!
JERRY: Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
ELAINE: (laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
JERRY: No, I don't.
ELAINE: So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
JERRY: My what?
ELAINE: Jeannie... your fiancee.
JERRY: Oh, yeah, that. Well...
ELAINE: All right. Spill it, Jerome.
JERRY: There's really not that much to tell.
(flashback sequence of Jerry and Jeannie at the coffee shop begins as Jerry narrates.)
"About a month ago, we were here having lunch, when all of a sudden we both just blurted out..."
JERRY & JEANNIE: (simultaneously) I hate you!
(They both chuckle over the coincidence.)
JEANNIE:: See ya.
JERRY: See ya.
(Jeannie returns her ring to Jerry, who puts it in his pocket.)
"It was unprecendented. I mean, it was the first truly mutual breakup in relationship history."
(flashback ends.)
JERRY: (continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
ELAINE: You've never felt remorse.
JERRY: I know, I feel bad about that...
ELAINE: I bet your parents were upset, huh?
JERRY: Eh.
ELAINE: You haven't told them yet, have you?
JERRY: No.
[J. Peterman's office.]
DUGAN: "So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria..."
J. PETERMAN: Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is.
Dugan: It's a, uh, washcloth.
J. PETERMAN: No washcloths!
ELAINE: Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
J. PETERMAN: (rubbing his neck) Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist.
ELAINE: Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
J. PETERMAN: Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.
ELAINE: Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
(Peterman walks out, groaning.)
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman?
[The street]
GEORGE: (inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
JERRY: Pride?
GEORGE: No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
JERRY: Well, you're your own boss now.
GEORGE: I wanna go to a tractor pull.
JERRY: Go ahead.
GEORGE: I am staying out all night!
JERRY: Who's stopping you?
GEORGE: I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
JERRY: Whatever.
(Jerry sees someone he knows.)
JERRY: Oh God.
GEORGE: What?
JERRY: It's Dolores.
GEORGE: Who?
JERRY: Mulva.
(Dolores notices Jerry.)
DOLORES: Jerry, hi.
JERRY: Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
GEORGE: Dolores!
DOLORES: Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged.
JERRY: Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
DOLORES: Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya.
JERRY: See ya.
GEORGE: Bye, Dolores.
(Dolores walks away.)
GEORGE: I thought Mulva hated you.
JERRY: Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
GEORGE: All the way?
JERRY: Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
GEORGE: Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
JERRY: You stink worse than I do!
GEORGE: I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
[J. Peterman's office.]
SECRETARY: Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone.
ELAINE: (answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
J. PETERMAN: Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer.
ELAINE: What? Well, who's gonna do it?
J. PETERMAN: What about you?
ELAINE: Me? Why me?
J. PETERMAN: Why, indeed.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
J. PETERMAN: I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma.
ELAINE: Burma?
J. PETERMAN: You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him)
(The phone is not hung up.)
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman?
[Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: Where?
ELAINE: Burma.
JERRY: Isn't it Myanmar now?
ELAINE: Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
JERRY: No, certainly not.
ELAINE: I mean, I can't give people orders!
JERRY: No one's gonna listen to you.
ELAINE: I am not qualified to run the catalog!
JERRY: You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
(Elaine groans in frustration as Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?
ELAINE: Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
KRAMER: Where?
JERRY: Myanmar.
KRAMER: The discount pharmacy?
ELAINE: Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
KRAMER: Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
ELAINE: Karate?
KRAMER: Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
ELAINE: Katra?
KRAMER: Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
JERRY: Sammy Davis had it.
KRAMER: So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
ELAINE: Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
KRAMER: Sure you have.
ELAINE: I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
KRAMER: You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
ELAINE: (excitedly) Okay.
(Kramer slams the door behind her.)
KRAMER: That kid is gonna be all right.
JERRY: No, she's not.
(There's a knock at Jerry's door.)
JOEY: Come on, Kramer!
KRAMER: Hey there.
JOEY: Come on. Mom's down in the car.
KRAMER: Okay, Joey.
(Joey exits.)
JERRY: You guys both have class at the same time?
KRAMER: No, we're in the same class.
JERRY: What do you mean you're in the same class?
KRAMER: He almost beat me.
JERRY: Kramer, you're fighting children?!
KRAMER: We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
JERRY: He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
(Car horn honks.)
KRAMER: I got carpool. (exits)
[Kramer's carpool.]
KRAMER: Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
JOEY: Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?
MRS. ZANFINO: Mmm, I don't know...
(The kids begin pleading, so Kramer joins in.)
MRS. ZANFINO: All right.
KIDS & KRAMER: Yay!
[J. Peterman's office. Elaine has called in all her new employees.]
DUGAN: *You're* taking the job?
ELAINE: You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
(As everyone rushes out, Elaine laughs, amazed at the new power she now holds.)
[Kramer's karate class.]
SANSEI: Are you prepared for kumite?
KRAMER & JOEY: Yes, Sansei.
SANSEI: Fight stance.
(Kramer & Joey assume fight stance.)
SANSEI: Hydjama! Begin!
(Kramer then frantically makes several karate hand motions, intimidating Joey. What follows is a montage of sequences featuring Kramer challenging his class. He grabs an opponent by the foot and flips him over; knocks one out with a simple karate chop to the head; has another turned upside down being shaken violently; drags another along the floor; and chases several at once.)
SANSEI: (raising Kramer's arm) Winner!
(The other kids bow their heads in disgrace.)
[George's apartment, in a very cluttered state. George is walking around in nothing but boxers, humming to himself while carrying a soda and a block of cheese. There's a knock at his door.]
GEORGE: It's open!
(As George plops onto the sofa, the Rosses enter.)
GEORGE: (surprised) Rosses.
MRS. ROSS: Hello, George.
GEORGE: Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
MR. ROSS: We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.
GEORGE: Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
MRS. ROSS: We know the last three months have been hard on you.
GEORGE: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
MR. ROSS: And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.
GEORGE: Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
MR. ROSS: That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.
GEORGE: Oh, that's wonderful.
MR. ROSS: And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.
GEORGE: Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
MR. ROSS: You'll be on the board of directors.
GEORGE: (feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
MRS. ROSS: Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.
GEORGE: I can't believe this is happening.
MR. ROSS: Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, w-what was it, dear?
MRS. ROSS: Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?
MR. ROSS: Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.
MRS. ROSS: So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?
GEORGE: (feigning happiness) The second I see him.
[The coffee shop. Jerry is having lunch when George walks in.]
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: Hey. How's your day, good?
JERRY: Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
GEORGE: So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
JERRY: Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
GEORGE: What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
JERRY: No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
GEORGE: That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
JERRY: (stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
GEORGE: The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
JERRY: Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
GEORGE: Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
JERRY: Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
GEORGE: Don't you see? I'm back in.
JERRY: All because of Wrath of Khan?
GEORGE: Yes!
JERRY: Well, it was the best of those movies.
(The camera is over George's head and spins around repeatedly as George screams.)
GEORGE: KHAN!
[The foundation. George is staring intently at a painting of Susan as Wyck walks in.]
WYCK: George.
(George doesn't respond.)
WYCK: George. (taps him on the shoulder)
GEORGE: (startled) Oh!
WYCK: I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.
GEORGE: Wink.
WYCK: (correcting him) Wyck.
GEORGE: Wyck.
WYCK: Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.
GEORGE: Oh. I know they have some monies.
WYCK: They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.
GEORGE: So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
WYCK: Yes.
GEORGE: And now?
WYCK: Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.
GEORGE: This townhouse?
WYCK: This would have been your wedding gift.
GEORGE: And now?
WYCK: Not.
GEORGE: Not.
WYCK: Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.
GEORGE: You know, it really can't.
[The coffee shop.]
DOLORES: So who broke it off?
JERRY: Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
DOLORES: Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.
JERRY: I am. It was the world's first.
DOLORES: You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits)
JERRY: Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
[Jerry's apartment. The phone is ringing as he's getting in.]
JERRY: (answering) Hello?
SECRETARY: Please hold for Elaine Benes.
JERRY: Oh, I don't believe this.
ELAINE: (picking up) Jerry!
JERRY: Hey!
ELAINE: Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
JERRY: How's it look?
ELAINE: (muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
JERRY: Huh?
ELAINE: I say, it's a peach.
JERRY: Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
ELAINE: No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
JERRY: I gotta do some research here.
ELAINE: Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
JERRY: Oh, I'm the doofus?
ELAINE: Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
JERRY: You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
ELAINE: Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
JERRY: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[Kramer's karate class. Kramer is beating his opponent, a little girl. Elaine walks in, surprised.]
ELAINE: Kramer!
KRAMER: Oh, hey.
ELAINE: What are you doing?
KRAMER: Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.
ELAINE: You never said you were fighting children.
KRAMER: Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
ELAINE: This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
KRAMER: No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
ELAINE: Search... for Spock?!
KRAMER: Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
ELAINE: (pushes him) You doofus!
(As Kramer is knocked down, there is amazed murmuring among his peers.)
[The coffee shop. Jerry is conducting some research.]
JERRY: Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
WAITRESS #1: More.
WAITRESS #2: Less.
RUTHIE: Same.
WILLIE: Are we about through here?
(Jerry crosses off something on his clipboard.)
[A dark, foggy street. Kramer is walking with Joey.]
KRAMER: I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
JOEY: She had a little change of plans.
(Children emerge from various places in the alley, to ambush Kramer.)
KRAMER: What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
GIRL: Now we finish it.
(Kramer tries to escape up the fire escape ladder, but the kids drag him down.)
KRAMER: Aah! Aah! Mama!
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: (on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
(Elaine enters.)
JERRY: Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
(The phone rings again expectedly. Jerry hangs up without answering.)
JERRY: So... did you stop by the dojo?
ELAINE: Yep.
JERRY: How's your confidence level?
ELAINE: Shot.
JERRY: Self-esteem?
ELAINE: Gone.
JERRY: Doofus?
ELAINE: (raises her hand) Yo.
JERRY: All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
(Elaine takes out the Urban Sombrero and puts it on.)
JERRY: What is that?
ELAINE: It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
JERRY: Well, nobody sees the... cover.
(Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: God!
JERRY: What happened to you?
KRAMER: Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
JERRY: It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
KRAMER: Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
ELAINE: (pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
KRAMER: Well, then I was way off!
ELAINE: Well, I'll see ya... (exits)
JERRY: Vaya con dios.
KRAMER: (with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
JERRY: No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
KRAMER: You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
JERRY: Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
[The foundation]
WYCK: Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.
GEORGE: Would I have had access to that?
WYCK: Of course, it would have been yours.
GEORGE: And now?
(Wyck turns to face him.)
GEORGE: (anticipating the answer) Not.
(phone rings. George eagerly answers it.)
GEORGE: Hello?
JERRY: Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
GEORGE: My story?
JERRY: Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
GEORGE: Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
WYCK: (chuckling) Oh, no, not even close.
GEORGE: (remorsefully) I can't go.
JERRY: What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
(George hangs up.)
WYCK: Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?
(George turns to the portrait of Susan in amazement.)
[George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.]
GEORGE: You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
WYCK: Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?
GEORGE: I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
WYCK: Pardon?
GEORGE: (mutters it again)
WYCK: Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate (clears his throat)...accident.
(George looks at Wyck suspiciously.)
[George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.]
JERRY: He cleared his throat?
GEORGE: Yes!
JERRY: So?
GEORGE: He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
JERRY: Not getting it.
GEORGE: Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
JERRY: Oh, help me, Rhonda.
GEORGE: What time is it?
JERRY (looks at his watch): 1:15.
GEORGE: Right now?
JERRY: I gotta go meet Pam.
GEORGE: Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
JERRY: Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
GEORGE: Where's Elaine?
JERRY: She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
GEORGE: What's with all these people having babies?
JERRY: Perpetuation of the species.
GEORGE: Yeah! Right!
JERRY: By the way, just for the record -
GEORGE: No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
[Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.]
CAROL: ...but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!
ELAINE: Well, that's...that's sweet.
GAIL: Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.
CAROL: Elaine, you gotta have a baby!
ELAINE: Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
LISA: Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.
ELAINE: I really like the city.
CAROL: The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?
ELAINE: Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
CAROL: Oh! I have pictures!
ELAINE: No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
CAROL (shows Elaine and the girls pictures of Adam): Look at him! Just look at him!
(Elaine is revolted by the sight of "breathtaking" little Adam.)
[Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.]
JERRY: So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
GEORGE: Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
JERRY: You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
GEORGE: Jerry Lewis?
JERRY: I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
GEORGE: That's pretty paranoid.
JERRY: Yes, it is.
GEORGE: I like it!
JERRY: I thought you might.
[Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.]
PAM: Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. (Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.) Jerry's told me a lot about you. (Kramer continues grinning.) Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.
KRAMER (mouths the words): Books. (Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.)
PAM: Oh, careful! (Jerry enters.)
JERRY: Hi, sorry I'm late.
PAM: That's okay. Kramer let me in.
JERRY: You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
PAM: Okay. (Touches Kramer's hand) It was really nice meeting you.
(Jerry and Pam leave. Kramer sniffs his hand where Pam touched him, and makes a delighted noise.)
[Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.]
KRAMER: I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
NEWMAN: Go on.
KRAMER: Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
NEWMAN: Ah, yes. Forbidden love.
KRAMER: She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
NEWMAN: "Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.
KRAMER: I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
NEWMAN: Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? (Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.)
KRAMER: She has delicate beauty.
NEWMAN: Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.
KRAMER: And yet, he's my friend.
NEWMAN: And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
KRAMER: Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
NEWMAN: One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.
KRAMER: I thought we were talking about me.
NEWMAN: Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.
KRAMER: Confront Jerry? I can't.
NEWMAN: You must!
KRAMER: I won't!
NEWMAN: You will!
[Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.]
ELAINE (to Jerry, imitating Carol): "Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh.
GEORGE: Where are all the poetry magazines?
ELAINE: The New Yorker has poetry.
GEORGE: Yes. The New Yorker.
JERRY: Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
ELAINE: They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
JERRY: C'mon, you want to have a baby.
ELAINE: Why? Because I can?
JERRY: It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
ELAINE: Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
KEVIN: I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying.
ELAINE: Oh, I'm sorry.
KEVIN: No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.
ELAINE: Yeah, like you must procreate.
KEVIN: Besides, anyone can do it.
ELAINE: Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
[George in another meeting at the Foundation. He has a briefcase with a tape recorder in it.]
GEORGE: I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
WYCK: Are you okay, George?
GEORGE: No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
(George is shown standing on the street while the tape rolls inside the briefcase.)
Cut back to the Foundation meeting.
WYCK: ...and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... (George returns and retrieves the briefcase.)
GEORGE (apologetic): Briefcase. (Shrugs and exits.)
[Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.]
ELAINE: So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
KEVIN: Not at all.
ELAINE: 'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
KRAMER (wipes chocolate off his face): Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.
ELAINE: Oh. Are you alright?
KRAMER: Yeah, I'll be okay.
ELAINE: You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
KRAMER: Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
ELAINE: Oh, no...that won't last.
KRAMER: What do you mean?
ELAINE: He's not ga-ga.
(Kramer suddenly looks elated and runs out.)
[George shows up at Jerry's apartment later that night with the briefcase.]
GEORGE: Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
JERRY: How long did you leave it up there?
GEORGE: Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
JERRY: Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
GEORGE: I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
(George plays back the tape. We hear a voice ask, "Did anyone notice George's fingernails?" Then a female voice answering, "Oh my, yes. They looked like they were eaten away by weavels." The male voice remarks, "It's warm in here. Open a window." Then, "Hey! What are you doing?" The female voice exclaims, "Dear God." There's a clunking sound on the tape, and the recording ends.)
JERRY: Is that it?
GEORGE: Stopped dead.
JERRY: What do you make of it?
GEORGE: I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
KRAMER: Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
GEORGE (to Kramer): Kinda busy here.
KRAMER: I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
GEORGE: Why can't I stay?
KRAMER: Because it doesn't concern you.
GEORGE: Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
JERRY: So, what's on your mind?
KRAMER: It's Pam.
JERRY: Pam? What about Pam?
KRAMER: I love her, Jerry!
JERRY: You what?
KRAMER: I love her!
JERRY: Is that right?
KRAMER: Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
JERRY: What does that mean?
KRAMER: Oh, and that voice!
JERRY: What about her name?
KRAMER: Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
JERRY: She's got really nice hair.
KRAMER: Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
JERRY: You've got really specific tastes.
KRAMER: Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
JERRY: She's got nice calves.
KRAMER: Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
JERRY: Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
KRAMER: No you can't, Jerry.
JERRY: But I might.
KRAMER: Oh, no you don't.
JERRY: Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
KRAMER: What...?
JERRY: I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
KRAMER (frantic): Huh?
JERRY: Pam!
KRAMER: Huh?
JERRY: Pam!
KRAMER: Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
[Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.]
KRAMER: So now he wants her more than ever!
NEWMAN: Blast!
KRAMER: What am I gonna do, huh?
NEWMAN: Don't despair, my friend. (Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.) I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.
KRAMER: What, again with you?
NEWMAN: Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.
KRAMER: If only I could say things like that around her.
NEWMAN (getting an idea): Yes...
[Elaine and George at the coffee shop listening to the briefcase tape.]
ELAINE: Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
GEORGE: Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
ELAINE: ...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
GEORGE: It's baffling, isn't it?
ELAINE: Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
GEORGE: They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
JERRY: That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
ELAINE: Ga-ga? When did that happen?
JERRY: Yesterday. Six-ish.
ELAINE: Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
JERRY: You just met the guy yesterday.
ELAINE: Yeah, but we have a common goal.
JERRY: A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
ELAINE (happily): Yeah.
GEORGE: And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
ELAINE: Yeah, of course.
JERRY: Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
ELAINE: Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
GEORGE: Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
JERRY: I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
GEORGE: I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
[Kramer and Newman in an aisle at the bookstore where Pam works.]
NEWMAN: With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. (Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.)
PAM: Oh, hi! Kramer.
NEWMAN (whispers through the bookcase): Hi. How are you?
KRAMER: Hi. How are you?
PAM: I'm great.
NEWMAN: I too am well.
KRAMER: I too am well.
NEWMAN: Do I smell Pantene?
KRAMER: Do I smell?
NEWMAN: Pantene!
KRAMER: Uh, Pantene.
PAM: Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.
KRAMER (talks rapidly in an attempt to keep up with Newman): Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...
NEWMAN (frantic): ...it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...
KRAMER: Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
PAM: What?
KRAMER: Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
PAM: That's so true.
KRAMER: Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
NEWMAN: Shell.
KRAMER: ...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
PAM: Kramer, that is so lovely.
KRAMER: It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
PAM: Oh, what's his name?
KRAMER: Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
[Elaine and Kevin in Elaine's apartment.]
KEVIN: Elaine, you've changed my life.
ELAINE: Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
KEVIN: I got a vasectomy this morning.
ELAINE: Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
[Jerry talking with Pam at the bookstore. ]
JERRY: I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
PAM: Oh. Well, that's um...(clears her throat)...nice. (Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.)
JERRY's brain: A velvet scrunchie!
JERRY: Kramer!
[Jerry approaching his apartment door. He meets Newman coming out of Kramer's place.]
JERRY: Hello, Newman.
NEWMAN: Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?
JERRY: Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
NEWMAN: Well, ta-ta! (Scampers away.)
JERRY: Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
JERRY: Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
NEWMAN (sweating): Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this.
JERRY: Why not?
NEWMAN: Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. (Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.)
JERRY (rolls his eyes): C'mon. (They exit.)
[Jerry and Newman in Newman's apartment.]
JERRY: I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
NEWMAN: I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.
JERRY: I thought we were talking about me.
NEWMAN: Right.
JERRY: Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
NEWMAN: Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?
JERRY: Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
NEWMAN: Well, there is a little something you can do for me...
JERRY: C'mon, out with it.
NEWMAN: It's about...Elaine.
JERRY: Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
NEWMAN: You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!
JERRY (shrugs): Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. (Newman considers the implications of this.)
[Cut back to Elaine and Kevin at Elaine's apartment.]
KEVIN: I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.
ELAINE: I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.
KEVIN: What was that?
ELAINE: Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
KEVIN: This is! Oh boy, I always do this.
ELAINE: What?
KEVIN: Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it.
ELAINE: Really?
KEVIN: Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.
ELAINE: You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
KEVIN: Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!
ELAINE: Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
KEVIN: Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.
ELAINE: Yeah!
KEVIN: Yeah!
[Jerry and George in Jerry's kitchen. George has brought over a model of the conference room at the Foundation.]
GEORGE: This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
JERRY: When did you build this thing?
GEORGE: Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
JERRY (points at the Power Ranger): Wait, that's you?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JERRY (picks up a yellow M&M toy from the model): I really think the M&M should be you.
GEORGE (grabs the M&M away from Jerry): Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...(drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model)...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.
JERRY: And?
GEORGE: Okay. That's what we know.
JERRY: But we already knew that.
GEORGE: Well, yeah.
JERRY: Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
GEORGE: I don't know if you're ready for it.
JERRY: Please.
GEORGE: I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
JERRY: Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
VOICE ON SPEAKER: It's Pam.
JERRY: C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
GEORGE: I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
PAM: What was that?
JERRY: We were just playin.'
PAM: Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...
JERRY: Uh huh...
PAM: Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. (Kramer slides in the door on his knees.)
KRAMER: I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
JERRY (to Pam): This is the man you have a crush on?
PAM: Well, I have feelings for both of you.
KRAMER: How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
JERRY: Why can't I be a soul mate?
KRAMER: Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
PAM: Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.
(Jerry and Kramer look at each other, puzzled.)
[George back at the conference room at the Foundation.]
GEORGE: There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
WYCK: George...
GEORGE: You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
WYCK: George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?
GEORGE: Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
[Jerry and Newman in the office of Bernard Wendroff, M.D. - urologist. Elaine and Kevin enter. Elaine has cut her hair short.]
ELAINE: What are you guys doing here?
JERRY: We're getting vasectomies.
ELAINE: Why?
NEWMAN (to Elaine): I'm doing it for you.
ELAINE: What?
JERRY (to Elaine): What'd you do to your hair?
ELAINE: I cut it.
JERRY: It's a little short.
KEVIN: Y'think?
JERRY (to Kevin): What are you doing here?
ELAINE: Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
JERRY and NEWMAN: Reversed?! (Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.)
[George reading the poem for Susan at the Foundation.]
GEORGE: ...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
WYCK: Is that a Keats poem?
GEORGE: No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
WYCK: Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?
MR. CROSS: Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.
MS. BAINES: Of course he killed her.
WYCK: So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.
[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]
JERRY: All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.
GEORGE: Fine.
JERRY: They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
GEORGE: I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
JERRY: But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
GEORGE: I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
JERRY: (resigned) At least it's show business..
GEORGE: But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
JERRY: What if she's got no interest in you?
GEORGE: W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
[Exterior long shot: looking up at an office building; Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]
KRAMER: George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
GEORGE: Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
KRAMER: (frustrated) Wha??
JERRY: (dry) He knows.
GEORGE: (Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
KRAMER: (impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
GEORGE: You sure?
JERRY: (dry) He knows.
(KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them. She could be a model.)
GEORGE: Wow. Nice.
JERRY: Why don't you try your engagement story?
GEORGE: (considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.
JERRY: Are you sure?
GEORGE: (wry) He knows.
[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored, dreading.]
ELAINE: Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
KEVIN: Friends?
ELAINE: Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
KEVIN: Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
(Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.)
MAN: (frustrated) Damn thing is jammed again..
KRAMER: You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
MAN #2 (rushing by, tense) Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.
MAN: Come on, let's go.
KRAMER: (absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]
ELAINE: (to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
JERRY: (doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
(ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.)
JERRY: Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
ELAINE: (dry) I put her stats on the back.
JERRY: Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed: "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
GEORGE: Hnn! Let me see that.
JERRY: (hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
ELAINE: (laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
JERRY: Why would anybody want a friend.
ELAINE: (dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
JERRY: I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
GEORGE: (still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiancée..
JERRY: What?
GEORGE: Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
ELAINE: (wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
GEORGE: (getting up) Can I keep this?
ELAINE: No, I need it.
GEORGE: (absently leaving with it) Thanks.
[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]
GEORGE: Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
AMANDA: I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..
GEORGE: (taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
AMANDA: Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?
GEORGE: (humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiancée, Susan. May she rest in peace.
AMANDA: Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.
GEORGE: (shaking hands) I'm George.
(As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.)
MAN #3: Good work today, K-man!
KRAMER Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.
MAN #3: Heh, heh!
KRAMER: You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
MAN #3: In that case, make mine a double!
(They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.)
[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]
GILLIAN: Jerry?
JERRY: Gillian. Hiii..
GILLIAN: Very nice to meet you.
JERRY: It's nice to meet you!
(They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.)
[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]
JERRY: She had man-hands.
ELAINE: (pause) Man, Hands?
JERRY: The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
ELAINE: (weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
JERRY: Would she have hooks?
ELAINE: Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
JERRY: Kinda cool lookin'..
ELAINE: (getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
JERRY: (leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
ELAINE: Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
JERRY: Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
ELAINE: (weary) Jerry!
[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom, tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]
JERRY: Kramer?!
KRAMER: Hey buddy! Hey!
JERRY: It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
KRAMER: Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
JERRY: Why??
KRAMER: Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
JERRY: (disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
KRAMER: Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
JERRY: (snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
KRAMER: But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
JERRY: How much are they payin' you?
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
JERRY: Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
KRAMER: T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
JERRY: All right.
KRAMER: (leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
JERRY: W-w-wha' you got in there?
KRAMER: (as he leaves with it) Crackers.
(MUSIC (Sheena Easton's "Morning Train (Nine to Five)") accompanies assorted shots of working-man Kramer: Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction). Washing his shoes at the water cooler. Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase. Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF-type restaurant.)
[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]
JERRY: So the picture worked. Amazing!
GEORGE: Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
JERRY: I don't know, but you don't have it.
GEORGE: Right. Bye.
(ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.)
ELAINE: Where were you today?
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: Pick. Up.
JERRY: (whispers) Damn.
ELAINE: So? Where were you?!
JERRY: Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
ELAINE: (irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
JERRY: So? What are friends for?
ELAINE: Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
JERRY: So he's Bizarro Jerry!
ELAINE: (pause) Bizarro Jerry?
JERRY: Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
ELAINE: (pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
JERRY: No. It's still a goodbye.
ELAINE: Uh. Does he live underwater?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: Is he black..
JERRY: Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?
(KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.)
KRAMER: Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
JERRY: Tough day at the office?
KRAMER: Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
JERRY: Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
KRAMER: Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
[Exterior of cheap-looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black-walled dance bar full of gorgeous women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]
GEORGE: This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
(Three female MODELS come up to them.)
MODEL #1: Hey! Amanda!
AMANDA: These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.
GEORGE: Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
AMANDA: So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?
MODEL #2: (petulant) A bore.
GEORGE: You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiancée, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
(shows them the picture)
MODEL #3: (awed) Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?
[Exterior of a restaurant.]
(Close-up of GILLIAN's man-hands tearing restaurant bread in half.)
(GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.)
GILLIAN: Would you like some bread, Jerry?
JERRY: No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
GILLIAN: Well, then at least drink your beer.. (she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands)
JERRY: (to self) Oh. Twist off..
GILLIAN: You have a little something on your face.
JERRY: I can get it. (feeling his face)
GILLIAN: Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. (reaches over)
(A close-up of his face while a man-hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.)
GILLIAN: (friendly) It's an eyelash. Make a wish.
(Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.)
JERRY: I don't want to.
GILLIAN: Make a wish.
JERRY: Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
GILLIAN: (smiles at him) Don't you just love lobster?
(Closeup of her man-hands tearing open a lobster.)
[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]
KEVIN: That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.
ELAINE: I know, he's so tiny!
(Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.)
KEVIN: Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call "Feldman!"
(GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy-looking. ELAINE sits with them.)
ELAINE: (to self in head) Bizarro world..
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]
GEORGE: (delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
JERRY: Then it does exist.
GEORGE: Yes. The legends are true.
JERRY: So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
GEORGE: I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
JERRY: So you're gonna burn that bridge.
GEORGE: Flame on!
[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]
GENE: (about the check) I got it.
KEVIN: (grabs it) No. You got it last time.
GENE: (calmly takes it) Don't worry about it.
ELAINE: (to self in head) This is unbelievable..
FELDMAN: Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?
ELAINE: Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
FELDMAN: Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.
KEVIN: (getting up) Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. (the three guys are leaving)
ELAINE: What are you gonna do down there?
KEVIN: Read!
ELAINE: (pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe eating cereal and orange juice.]
JERRY: So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
KRAMER: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
KRAMER: Yeah..
JERRY: Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
KRAMER: That's nice..
JERRY: Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
KRAMER: Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
JERRY: I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
KRAMER: Oh here we go--
JERRY: An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
KRAMER: What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
JERRY: (pause) It's your third day..
KRAMER: (grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
JERRY: Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
(ELAINE's arrived.)
ELAINE: What? What is goin' on with you two?
JERRY: Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
ELAINE: All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
JERRY: Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
ELAINE: (stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
JERRY: The Bizarro coffeeshop?
ELAINE: Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
JERRY: I read.
ELAINE: Books, Jerry.
JERRY: (pause) Oh. Big deal..
ELAINE: Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
JERRY: (What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
ELAINE: I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
JERRY: (frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow-drier together on the side of the sink--the dryer's still running.]
GEORGE: Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]
GILLIAN: Friends. Just friends.
JERRY: Yeah.
GILLIAN: Yeah. All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?
JERRY: I wish I could, but, we're friends..
GILLIAN: I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.
JERRY: Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
GEORGE: (frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
JERRY: (to drive him crazy) Who is this..
GEORGE: Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
JERRY: (pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
GEORGE: Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
(JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.)
JERRY: Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]
KRAMER: Jerry. Hey Jerry?
JERRY: I'm right here. (note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
KRAMER: Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
JERRY: Like you care.
KRAMER: The work piled up, I lost track of time--
JERRY: (calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
KRAMER: You cooked?
JERRY: (calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
KRAMER: (in pain) Ow! Jeez!
JERRY: What's wrong?
KRAMER: (Ow!) It's my stomach.
JERRY: You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
KRAMER: (putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
JERRY: The coffeeshop?
KRAMER: You got it, buddy.
JERRY: (pleased) I'll call George!
[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a shop by a liquor store.]
JERRY: Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
GEORGE: (quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
JERRY: Elaine!
KRAMER: Elaine!
ALL THREE: Elaine! Elaine!
(ELAINE finally notices them, but suddenly from the other direction, three other guys are coming: GENE, KEVIN, and FELDMAN.)
KEVIN: Hey! Elaine! Hi-i! Over here!
(Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like a bizarre mirroring.)
ELAINE: Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
(The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you..")
JERRY: (quietly crept out) This is really weird..
(KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.)
ELAINE: (diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
KEVIN: Sure. (strolls away with his friends)
ELAINE: (pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
GEORGE: Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
JERRY: I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
(While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are friendly giving a beggar money.)
KEVIN: (Here ya are.)
ELAINE: (pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
(GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.)
GEORGE: Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?
ELAINE: I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
(KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.)
[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]
KRAMER: What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
LELAND: Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.
KRAMER: Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
LELAND: No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all.. I don't know what this is supposed to be!
KRAMER: Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
LELAND: Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.
KRAMER: I don't even really work here!
LELAND: That's what makes this so difficult.
[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]
GEORGE: Hi. George.
MODEL #4: Are you sure you're supposed to be here?
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiancée, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
MODEL #4: What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?
GEORGE: Huh?
MODEL #4: That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..
GEORGE: Ha! Heh.
(Muscled BOUNCER comes up.)
BOUNCER: Let's go. Private party. (escorts him out)
[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more earth tones.]
KEVIN: Who is it?
ELAINE: (off-camera) It's Lainey!
KEVIN: (unlocks, opens door) Hi Elaine! (warmly hugs her)
ELAINE: Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
KEVIN: Come on in!
ELAINE: Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
(As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall. There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.)
ELAINE: What's up?
KEVIN: (friendly) Just reading..
(ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the living room area, KEVIN is looking at her. Note: a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.)
KEVIN: Hey.. What're you doing?
ELAINE: Eatin' olives.
KEVIN: Have you ever heard of asking? (door bell rings) Who is it?
FELDMAN: (off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall.
KEVIN: (drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door) Hold on. (unlocks and opens door) Hey.
FELDMAN: He-ey, Kevin!
KEVIN: Hi.
FELDMAN: Look who I ran into.
(VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.)
VARGUS: (testy) Hello, Kevin..
KEVIN: (testy) Hello, Vargus..
(They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.)
KEVIN: Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?
VARGUS: Great! I'll see ya later! (leaves)
KEVIN: Okay. (to self, smiling) Vargus.. (to FELDMAN) So?
FELDMAN: I got 'em..
KEVIN: All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!
ELAINE: Oh! (comes to him)
KEVIN: (enthused) Fourth row, center.
ELAINE: Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
(GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!)
GENE: (to ELAINE) What is the matter with you?
ELAINE: Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
GENE: Haven't you done enough already?
(Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the locks.)
ELAINE: (turning to them, awkward) It's locked..
(The meat-packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps into a side of beef in his distraction.)
JERRY: So this is it, huh?
GEORGE: But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
JERRY: (dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
(Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.)
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. The familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny "Brady Bunch"-esque sound effects.; Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking]
GENE: At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.
KEVIN: Oh, so what did you do?
GENE: I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.
KEVIN: Nice. (doorbell rings) Who is it?
FELDMAN: (off-screen) Feldman.. From across the hall.
KEVIN: (smiles, relieved) Hold on.
(GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.)
FELDMAN: Kevin! Brought some groceries.
KEVIN: Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!
FELDMAN: Hey, what are friends for?
KEVIN: You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
(They have a long smarmy group hug.)
KEVIN: (eyes closed in hug) Oh. Me so happy. Me want to cry.
[Jerry and Kramer walking down the street. Jerry is closest to the street.]
KRAMER: I wouldn't walk over there.
JERRY: Why not?
KRAMER: It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
JERRY: What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
KRAMER: I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
JERRY: No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
KRAMER: Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
JERRY: You were livin' in the village then, right?
KRAMER: Don't really remember.
[Coffee shop, Jerry and Elaine]
ELAINE: (Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
JERRY: That is disgusting.
ELAINE: You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
JERRY: Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
ELAINE: I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
JERRY: (George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
ELAINE: I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
JERRY: Like with dogs.
ELAINE: Exactly.
GEORGE: Party?
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: Food?
ELAINE: Uh huh.
GEORGE: Bar?
ELAINE: Yeah.
GEORGE: George?
JERRY: He's gonna show up anyway.
ELAINE: George, I just don't want you interfering.
GEORGE: How could I possibly interfere?
JERRY: Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
[At Elaine's party]
GEORGE: (Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
ANNA: No thanks.
GEORGE: Hi ah, My name is George.
ANNA: Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room?
GEORGE: No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
ANNA: Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves)
GEORGE: So...
MAN: How 'bout leading us in a toast?
ELAINE: Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
GEORGE: Sweet Fancy Moses!
[Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters]
KRAMER: You get the tickets?
JERRY: Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
KRAMER: Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
JERRY: Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
KRAMER: Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
[Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.]
JERRY: Yeah I guess I do owe you.
KRAMER: Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
JERRY: No, I'm okay.
KRAMER: There's no problem, really.
JERRY: I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
GEORGE: Food was good.
JERRY: Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
GEORGE: Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
JERRY: Elaine danced?
GEORGE: It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
JERRY: Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
GEORGE: What, you mean you know about this?
JERRY: For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
GEORGE: Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
JERRY: And by then you've lost interest.
GEORGE: Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
JERRY: What made him get that thing?
GEORGE: During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
JERRY: Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
KRAMER: Brody's in.
JERRY: I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
KRAMER: Well, you better get on the horn.
[Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone]
ELAINE: I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
JERRY: How could that be?
ELAINE: Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
JERRY: No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
ELAINE: Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
JERRY: Oh, what are you talkin' about?
ELAINE: He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
JERRY: Now you're talkin' crazy!
ELAINE: All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
JERRY: (Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
[Elaine's office, Anna enters]
ANNA: You have a minute to approve some copy?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
ANNA: It was a real... kick.
ELAINE: Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
ANNA: As a matter of fact I did.
ELAINE: Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
ANNA: Why? He seems harmless.
ELAINE: Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
ANNA: Really?
ELAINE: Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
ANNA: And you two are friends?
ELAINE: Yeah, we're good friends.
[Coffee shop]
GEORGE: So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
JERRY: Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
GEORGE: With extreme prejudice.
JERRY: Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
GEORGE: No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
JERRY: Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
GEORGE: I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
JERRY: You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
GEORGE: Yes ... yes, yes
JERRY: The bad fiancé&Mac226, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
GEORGE: Okay, the point is made.
JERRY: The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
[At the movies...]
JERRY: Half of show business is here.
KRAMER: There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
BRODY: Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.
JERRY: That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
BRODY: It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
KRAMER: Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
JERRY: I'm a joke maker.
KRAMER: All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
JERRY: (To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
KRAMER: Relax, he does that all the time.
JERRY: Does what?
KRAMER: He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
JERRY: May I see you outside for a moment please?
KRAMER: But I want to--
JERRY: Outside!
[Elaine's office]
ELAINE: Hey, have you seen Anna?
WORKER: Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.
ELAINE: To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
WORKER: The park, why?
ELAINE: Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
[Outside the theater at the movies.]
JERRY: What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
KRAMER: Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
JERRY: It's not legitimate.
KRAMER: It's a business.
JERRY: Where did you meet this guy?
KRAMER: He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
JERRY: Kramer. (boom sound)
KRAMER: Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!
JERRY: I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
[Anna and George in the park.]
ANNA: You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
GEORGE: No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
ANNA: No... a little. Nice car.
GEORGE: Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
ANNA: Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
GEORGE: Maybe.
ANNA: Well is it or isn't it?
GEORGE: Guess not.
(Elaine arrives.)
ELAINE: (To George) Stay away from her.
GEORGE: I didn't do nothin'.
ELAINE: (To Anna) Get in the car.
ANNA: But...
ELAINE: You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
GEORGE: Lighten up.
(As they leave George points and winks at Anna.)
[Death Blow...]
KRAMER: Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
(Movie Voice: So Death Blow, we meet again ...)
BRODY: Uh, I got a cramp.
KRAMER: Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
BRODY: Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.
JERRY: Hey, what is going on over there?
BRODY: Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.
JERRY: Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
KRAMER: Jerry, if the man is in pain...
JERRY: Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
BRODY: (pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?
KRAMER: Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
JERRY: All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
KRAMER: (To Brody) C'mon, let's go.
JERRY: Oh man...
[Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
JERRY: How was the rest of Death Blow?
KRAMER: Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
JERRY: Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
KRAMER: He's quite a character, isn't he?
JERRY: You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
(buzzer)
KRAMER: I got it. Yep.
BRODY: Brody.
KRAMER: Come on up. It's Brody.
JERRY: What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
KRAMER: Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
JERRY: What if I didn't do it right?
KRAMER: It's your first time. He'll understand.
JERRY: People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
(Brody enters)
KRAMER: Hey, Brody!
JERRY: Hi.
BRODY: Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.
JERRY: Yeah.
BRODY: I've never seen such beautiful work.
JERRY: What?
BRODY: (con,t) You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted.
JERRY: Well, I did the best I could.
BRODY: I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.
(Brody's beeper sounds)
BRODY: May I use your phone?
KRAMER: Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
(Brody exits to Kramer's apartment.)
KRAMER: Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
JERRY: I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
KRAMER: But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
JERRY: We're talkin' federal crime here.
(Brody enters.)
BRODY: (To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat)
KRAMER: Sure, do you need a glove?
BRODY: Nah.
[A meeting at Elaine's office]
WORKER: I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh)
ELAINE: What? What is so funny?
(Anna enters with Yankee jacket on.)
ANNA: Sorry, I got hung up.
ELAINE: At Yankee Stadium?
ANNA: This? It's mine.
ELAINE: Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
ANNA: He's not stocky.
(Elaine turns around. A paper airplane is thrown at her.)
ELAINE: Who did that? Who did that?!?
[Cry, Cry Again, Kramer is bootlegging.]
KRAMER: (laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
[Jerry's apartment watching the tape.]
JERRY: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
KRAMER: That's fine.
JERRY: Do you even know what this scene is about?
KRAMER: It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
JERRY: No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
(Gesturing taking a loaf of bread.)
KRAMER: Wha? Where?
JERRY: Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
KRAMER: Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
JERRY: I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
KRAMER: So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
JERRY: I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
KRAMER: Right here. (Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
KRAMER: (He shows her) This umpf thing.
ELAINE: It's dancing.
KRAMER: No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
ELAINE: I dance fine.
KRAMER: You stink. (He exits)
ELAINE: He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
JERRY: I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
ELAINE: Jerry, do I stink?
JERRY: All right, you're beyond stink.
ELAINE: But I really enjoy dancing.
JERRY: And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
ELAINE: It's that bad?
JERRY: Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
(Elaine sees video camera)
[Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.]
VOICE: I have George Costanza still holding.
ELAINE: George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
GEORGE: Yo, Anna.
ANNA: Hi, George. What're you up to?
GEORGE: (Ironing) You don't wanna know.
ELAINE: Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
GEORGE: What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
ELAINE: Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
GEORGE: Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
ELAINE: I never should have given Anna the impression--
GEORGE: Pick it up, pick it up!
ELAINE: --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
GEORGE: Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
ELAINE: What?
GEORGE: You are ruinin' everything.
ELAINE: I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
ELAINE: George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
ANNA: Um, no, I don't think so.
ELAINE: No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
GEORGE: I'm a bad man!
[Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.]
BRODY: So where's the tape?
JERRY: No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
BRODY: I need the tape.
JERRY: You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
BRODY: Are you out of your mind?
JERRY: Kramer...
KRAMER: I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
BRODY: Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
JERRY: All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
KRAMER: Jerry...
JERRY: I'm off the project. (He exits)
KRAMER: Jerry!
BRODY: I want the tape.
KRAMER: Yeah.
[Jerry and George at Monk's.]
GEORGE: Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
JERRY: They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
GEORGE: Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
JERRY: Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
JERRY: Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
GEORGE: Did you say dangerous?
[Anna and George in George's car.]
GEORGE: I'm a bootlegger.
ANNA: You're a what?
GEORGE: I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
ANNA: Isn't that illegal?
GEORGE: I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
ANNA: Is this your FiberCon?
GEORGE: (Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
[Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.]
KRAMER: Jerry, George got arrested.
JERRY: What?
KRAMER: Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
JERRY: Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
BRODY: Brody, I'm comin' up.
JERRY: What're we gonna do?
KRAMER: Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
JERRY: I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
KRAMER: Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
BRODY: Where's the tape?
JERRY: Uh, well. It, uh...
BRODY: Is that it?
KRAMER: Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
BRODY: How'd it turn out?
KRAMER + JERRY: Uh... great.
KRAMER: Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
JERRY: Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
KRAMER: Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
JERRY: Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
[Police station, Anna and George sitting down.]
ANNA: (George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it.
GEORGE: Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
ELAINE: Anna...
ANNA: Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.
ELAINE: All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
FRANK: Okay, where's my boy?
GEORGE: Oh my God.
FRANK: I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)
GEORGE: Ow! Dad...
FRANK: Who put you up to this, was it her?
ELAINE: All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
FRANK: My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
ELAINE: You got that right.
FRANK: What the hell does that mean?
ELAINE: That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
FRANK: You sayin' you want a piece of me?
ELAINE: I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
FRANK: You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
[Jerry and Elaine walking down the street.]
JERRY: But he's an old man, Elaine.
ELAINE: Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
JERRY: (Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
ELAINE: Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
JERRY: No you don't.
MAN: You shot Death Blow?
JERRY: Yeah.
MAN: That was brilliant.
JERRY: Thank you. (They continue walking)
ELAINE: You were big.
JERRY: I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
ELAINE: Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
JERRY: I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
[Kramer and Newman at the park, smoking cigars]
KRAMER: Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.
NEWMAN: I guess there's not much action down there these days.
KRAMER: Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
NEWMAN: Yeah, tell me about it.
KRAMER: See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
NEWMAN: What keeps the water in there? I mean, why doesn't it disappear?
KRAMER: What would be the point in taking the water?
NEWMAN: It's gorgeous water. (pause) Do we own Bermuda?
KRAMER: No. It belongs to the British.
NEWMAN: Lucky krauts.
KRAMER: So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
NEWMAN: Oh, that's real.
KRAMER: I think so too.
[Elaine at the doctor's]
ATTENDANT: The doctor will be with you in a moment.
(Elaine looking at her chart)
ELAINE: Difficult?
DOCTOR: Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash of yours.
ELAINE: Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
DOCTOR: Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now about that rash......
ELAINE: But it was in pen. You fake erase.
DOCTOR: All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
ELAINE: What are you writing? Doctor.
[George at Photo Shop]
SHEILA: Here you go.
GEORGE: Thanks.
SHEILA: I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt.
GEORGE: Ohhhhhh
[Jerry, Kramer, and George at the apartment]
JERRY: No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
GEORGE: Smile
JERRY: What are you doing?
GEORGE: I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
JERRY: Extra teeth. I love that look.
GEORGE: Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
JERRY: What mustard stain?
GEORGE: Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
JERRY: Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
GEORGE: That's got nothing to do with it.
JERRY: I see. She's looking.
GEORGE: Yesssss.
KRAMER: Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
JERRY: They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
KRAMER: Would you like a refund?
JERRY: Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
KRAMER: Would you be interested?
JERRY: Well how are you going.....
KRAMER: Would you?
JERRY: I guess I would.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah.
(Elaine walks in)
ELAINE: You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
JERRY: Not the gown again.
ELAINE: No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
JERRY: They have gotten to know you.
(Kramer leaves with Jerry's stereo)
ELAINE: Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
GEORGE: Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
ELAINE: Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
JERRY: Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
ELAINE: Listen to me you little shi........
GEORGE: Smile.
[Elaine at another doctor's office]
DOCTOR: Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.
ELAINE: Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
(Nurse hands the doctor her chart)
DOCTOR: All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.
ELAINE: Where did you get my chart?
DOCTOR: From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.
ELAINE: You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine.
ELAINE: Please, please. It's really, really itchy.
(Doctor writes more stuff in her chart)
[Jerry at apartment]
(Knock, knock)
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Seinfeld?
JERRY: Yeah.
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: I got a package for you. Sign here.
JERRY: Who's it from?
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: No return address.
JERRY: What if I don't want it?
POSTAL WORKER: Are you refusing delivery?
JERRY: Maybe I am.
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why would you do that?
JERRY: I've never done it before.
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Why start now?
JERRY: Why not?
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: All right.
(George walks in)
GEORGE: Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
JERRY: I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
GEORGE: What do you think it's a bomb?
JERRY: It's not totally impossible.
GEORGE: Oh the ego on you.
JERRY: Why can't I be bombable?
GEORGE: Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
JERRY: I suppose you think your bombable.
GEORGE: Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
JERRY: There's more than a couple.
GEORGE: Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
JERRY: You don't have a Mercedes.
GEORGE: I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
JERRY: The driver seems a little put out.
GEORGE: No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
JERRY: Is that Burt Reynolds?
GEORGE: Wax Museum.
JERRY: Oh.
GEORGE: Oh. What is this?
JERRY: That's a lot of skin.
GEORGE: This must be Sheila from the photo place.
JERRY: You can barely see her face.
GEORGE: She must have slipped it in here.
(Kramer walks in)
KRAMER: I I I
GEORGE: Photo store Sheila.
KRAMER: Well hello Photo store Sheila.
GEORGE: All right. I will see you boys later.
JERRY: Where are you going?
GEORGE: To ask her out.
KRAMER: No, no. Your not playing the game.
GEORGE: What game?
KRAMER: She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
GEORGE: No good?
KRAMER: George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
GEORGE: Oh, I don't know.
KRAMER: Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
JERRY: Oh yeah I like this idea.
[Outside Uncle Leo's apartment]
UNCLE LEO: Hey Danny. Hello. How are you?
POSTAL WORKER DANNY: Hey Leo. Leo what's up with your nephew. He wouldn't except his package.
UNCLE LEO: Oh He wants it. He's just trying to be funny. Yeah I'll sign it .
[George and Elaine in taxi]
ELAINE: And then he starts writing on my chart.
GEORGE: Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
ELAINE: You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
GEORGE: I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
ELAINE: You are!?!
GEORGE: Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
ELAINE: Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
GEORGE: Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
ELAINE: Actually I thought he was very professional.
GEORGE: So it was a good experience.
ELAINE: Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
GEORGE: Nice.
ELAINE: Yeah it is nice actually.
[Elaine at another doctors]
ELAINE: I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
ATTENDANT: He can't see you Miss Benes, he's busy.
ELAINE: Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
(Elaine rubs the attendants phone on her neck. Soon after Elaine finds her chart and runs to the elevator)
ELAINE: Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
DR. BURKE: The chart Miss Benes.
(The doctor writes more stuff in it)
ELAINE: Oh please no more.
[Jerry at his apartment]
(George walks in)
JERRY: Hey
GEORGE: Where's Kramer?
JERRY: He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
GEORGE: Personal matter.
(Phone rings)
JERRY: Hello
UNCLE LEO: Jerry! It's your Uncle Leo! Hello!
JERRY: Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.
UNCLE LEO: I got your package.
JERRY: How did you get my package?
UNCLE LEO: What should I do with it?
JERRY: I don't know what you should do with it.
GEORGE: Tell him to open it.
JERRY: I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
UNCLE LEO: Jerry, Your cousin Jeffrey is in the Parks Production of "The Mikado". I want you to go see it with me.
JERRY: Open the package Leo.
UNCLE LEO: Okay. Opening.
JERRY: Opening.
(Through the phone: BOOM!!!)
[Jerry's apartment later that day; Jerry and Elaine]
ELAINE: So it wasn't a bomb.
JERRY: No, No bomb.
ELAINE: Well then what?
JERRY: Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
ELAINE: But he's okay?
JERRY: Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
(Elaine on phone)
ELAINE: Yeah I am still holding.
(Jerry opens his package)
JERRY: Is this my stereo?
(Kramer walks in)
KRAMER: Hey you got it.
JERRY: What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
KRAMER: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
JERRY: But you were supposed to get me a refund.
KRAMER: You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
JERRY: So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
KRAMER: It's just a write off for them.
JERRY: How is it a write off?
KRAMER: They just write it off.
JERRY: Write it off what?
KRAMER: Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
JERRY: You don't even know what a write off is.
KRAMER: Do you?
JERRY: No. I don't.
KRAMER: But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
JERRY: I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
(Elaine still on phone)
ELAINE: What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
JERRY: Still no luck
(Kramer leaves with a fan)
ELAINE: Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
JERRY: There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
ELAINE: There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
JERRY: Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
ELAINE: Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
JERRY: He's not that good.
Kramer and George at Kramer's apartment
GEORGE: Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
KRAMER: Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
GEORGE: You don't have your own camera.
KRAMER: Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
GEORGE: I feel fat.
KRAMER: No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
GEORGE: Well do you want me to take it off?
KRAMER: I don't know it's up to you.
GEORGE: Do you think it would be better if I did?
KRAMER: It might be. I mean whatever you want.
GEORGE: ALL RIGHT!!
KRAMER: That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
(Jerry leaving apartment)
KRAMER: You are a lover boy!!
JERRY: Oh yeah. This can't miss.
[Elaine sleeping in bed]
(Phone rings)
ELAINE: Hello.
GUY: Is this Elaine Marie Benes?
ELAINE: Yes. Who it this?
GUY: We are with the American Medical Association. Can you confirm the correct spelling of your last name? Is it B-e-n-e-s.
ELAINE: Yeah. What is this all about
GUY: Good bye.
ELAINE: Hello, hello.

[Uncle Leo and Elaine at Dr. Resnick's office]
UNCLE LEO: Elaine. Hello. What are you doing here?
ELAINE: Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
UNCLE LEO: No. I am going to ask him about my eyebrows.
ELAINE: Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
(Dr. Resnick walks in)
DR. RESNICK: Leo. I heard you had a little mishap.
UNCLE LEO: It was a fireball.
ELAINE: I should have never left him alone.
DR. RESNICK: And who are you?
ELAINE: I am his nurse... Poloma.
UNCLE LEO: You're not my nurse.
ELAINE: He has good days and bad.
DR. RESNICK: What seems to be the problem?
UNCLE LEO: Are my eyebrows going to grow back?
ELAINE: And he's has a bit of a rash.
DR. RESNICK: Really.
ELAINE: Yeah.
DR. RESNICK: Well there's been a bit of that going around lately. Will you excuse me Poloma. I just need to get some ointment.
ELAINE: I don't like this, it is to easy.
UNCLE LEO: Elaine...
ELAINE: Shut up! I think he's on to us.
UNCLE LEO: Elaine what about my eyebrows?
ELAINE: Shhhhhh. Here.
(Elaine draws fake eyebrows on him)
[Kramer and Jerry at Post Office]
JERRY: I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
ATTENDANT: I am sorry. It looks like the claim has been red flagged. Your under investigation.
JERRY: Investigation?
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
NEWMAN: Kramer you might as well run along. Jerry might be a while. Suspicion of mail fraud.
KRAMER: Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
[Uncle Leo at Dr. Resnick's office]
DR. RESNICK: I got your ointment. Where's your nurse?
UNCLE LEO: She left.
DR. RESNICK: No need to get angry. Calm down.
UNCLE LEO: I am calm.
DR. RESNICK: Leo I don't care for your demeanor.
UNCLE LEO: Demeanor?
DR. RESNICK: Now your just being difficult.
UNCLE LEO: What are you writing?
[George at photo store]
GEORGE: So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
SHEILA: I am glad George.
GEORGE: And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
SHEILA: Great.
GEORGE: Shall we say an hour.
(George leaves)
SHEILA: Hey Ron I got to go to lunch. Can you do a roll?
RON: No problem.
SHEILA: By the way. You know that model that is always in here. She's missing one of her lingerie shots. Have you seen it?
RON: No.
[Jerry and Newman at the Post Office]
NEWMAN: All right. Then let me ask you this. Didn't you find it interesting that your friend had the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo. Huh. I mean parcels are rarely damaged during shipping.
JERRY: Define rarely.
NEWMAN: Frequently.
JERRY: Are we about throw here Newman?
NEWMAN: It's pretty hot under these lights huh Seinfeld. Pretty....... Hot .
JERRY: Actually I am quite comfortable.
NEWMAN: Can I have a sip?
JERRY: No.
NEWMAN: Not going to play ball. Huh all right. Admit it that stereo was all ready busted.
JERRY: You can't prove anything.
NEWMAN: Is this or is this not your signature?
JERRY: No in a matter of fact it isn't.
NEWMAN: Uncle Leo? This case is closed pending further evidence. Jerry.
[Kramer and Elaine at doctor's]
ELAINE: Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
KRAMER: Yeah let me borrow your scarf.
ELAINE: This.
KRAMER: Yeah. All right one chart coming up.
ELAINE: Okay.
KRAMER: Bennette right?
ELAINE: Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
[Newman walking down the street]
NEWMAN: Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
[Kramer at doctor's]
KRAMER: I like what you've done with that.
ATTENDANT: May I help you?
KRAMER: Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
ATTENDANT: I see and what clinic is that again?
KRAMER: That's correct.
ATTENDANT: Excuse me.
KRAMER: From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
ATTENDANT: Really?
KRAMER: The Netherlands?
ELAINE: Where's my chart? Did you get it?
KRAMER: No.
ELAINE: What? What happened?
KRAMER: I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
[George at photo store]
SHEILA: I don't know where they could be.
GEORGE: Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
SHEILA: Well if I find them I'll call you.
GEORGE: And maybe we could go out and do something.
SHEILA: Sure.
RON: Hello.
GEORGE: Hi.
(George leaves)
SHEILA: So the little guy finally asked me out.
RON: Really?
SHEILA: Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere.
RON: Oh you know what happened. Some guy from the Post Office confiscated them. He left his card.
SHEILA: Newman?
[George and Jerry at Post Office]
GEORGE: I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
NEWMAN: Gentlemen, gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.
JERRY: I'm clean and you know it.
NEWMAN: Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his stereo performance.
JERRY: Where did you get that?
GEORGE: I think that's one of mine.
NEWMAN: It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clad.
JERRY: I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
NEWMAN: Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you are. A monster so vile.....
GUY: NEWMAN!!
NEWMAN: There will be a small fine.
JERRY: Okay.
GEORGE: Can we go now?
NEWMAN: Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.
JERRY: Oh my god!!
NEWMAN: This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing packet.
(Newman holds up a picture of Ron)
GEORGE: OH MY GOD!!!
NEWMAN: We have some questions we'd like you to answer.
JERRY: I have some questions of my own.
(Sheila walks in)
SHEILA: Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god, George!?!
GEORGE: Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
JERRY: The timeless art of seduction.
GEORGE: SHEILA!!!
[Jerry and a woman are eating at a restaurant.]
WOMAN: Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so limiting.
JERRY: My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
WOMAN: Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move I ever made.
JERRY: Mentor? You mean your boss.
WOMAN: Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me under her wing.
JERRY: Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
WOMAN: And I'm her protégé. You must have someone like that. You know, who guides you in your career path.
JERRY: Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
[George and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.]
GEORGE: I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
JERRY: Yes. And the mentor advises the protégé.
GEORGE: Is there any money involved?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: So what's in it for the mentor?
JERRY: Respect, admiration, prestige.
GEORGE: Pssh. Would the protégé pick up stuff for the mentor?
JERRY: I suppose if it was on the protégé's way to the mentor, they might.
GEORGE: Laundry? Dry cleaning?
JERRY: It's not a valet, it's a protégé.
GEORGE: Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
JERRY: (checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
GEORGE: Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
JERRY: Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
GEORGE: I guess it's on my resume.
(The phone rings, Jerry answers.)
JERRY: Hello?
VOICE: Please hold for Elaine Benes.
GEORGE: You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
JERRY: So get this book on tape.
GEORGE: You can't, it's a textbook.
ELAINE: Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
JERRY: Am I going? It was three nights ago.
ELAINE: What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
JERRY: Oh, it was a lovely affair.
ELAINE: Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
JEANINE: Eddie Sherman.
ELAINE: Alright, send him up here.
JERRY: You gonna do a little yelling?
ELAINE: I'm gonna do a little firing.
JERRY: That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
ELAINE: Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
(Jerry gets a dial tone and hangs up; he looks over at George who has nodded off with the book in his lap. Jerry picks up a peanut and tosses it at George, hitting him in the glasses and waking him up.)
JERRY: Hey, Copernicus?
[Elaine's office.]
JEANINE: Eddie Sherman is here.
ELAINE: Oh, great. Send him in.
(Eddie Sherman walks in dressed in full military fatigues. He speaks in a raspy voice.)
EDDIE: You wanted to see me?
ELAINE: Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
[Elaine and Jerry are at the coffee shop.]
JERRY: So, what did you say?
ELAINE: Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
JERRY: What? What did you--
ELAINE: Copywriter.
JERRY: He's writing copy?
ELAINE: Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
(Kramer walks in carrying a stack of flyers, he hands a few to Jerry and Elaine.)
KRAMER: Yowza yowza. Check it out.
JERRY: (reading) Jewish singles night?
KRAMER: I expect you both to be there.
ELAINE: I'm not Jewish.
KRAMER: Well neither am I.
JERRY: Well why are you going?
KRAMER: I'm not, I'm running it.
JERRY: What are you talking about?
KRAMER: Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
JERRY: Lomez is Jewish?
KRAMER: Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
ELAINE: (reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
KRAMER: Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
JERRY: Kramer, you know, I--
KRAMER: No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
ELAINE: (reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
KRAMER: Do you like tsimmis?
[Jerry and Abby are being seated in a restaurant.]
ABBY: My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.
JERRY: I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
ABBY: Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!
CYNTHIA: Hello, Abby.
ABBY: Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.
JERRY: Hello.
CYNTHIA: Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.
ABBY: Well come join us, we could pull up a chair.
CYNTHIA: Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you
night know him, he's a comic too.
JERRY: No kidding?
CYNTHIA: Kenny Bania.
JERRY: Bania?
(Bania enters.)
BANIA: Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck here's the best. The best, Jerry.
[George is on the subway, seated beside a blind man wearing headphones.]
GEORGE: Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
MAN: Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.
GEORGE: I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
MAN: Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
[George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: Reading for the Blind?
GEORGE: I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
JERRY: So, I finally met the mentor.
GEORGE: What's she like? Impressive?
JERRY: Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
GEORGE: Bania?
JERRY: Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
GEORGE: What did you have?
JERRY: Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
GEORGE: Marsala?
JERRY: Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
GEORGE (leaving) Alright, I got a test to fail.
JERRY: Hey, good luck with that.
GEORGE: Thank you.
(George opens the door to see Kramer and Frank leaving Kramer's apartment.)
GEORGE: Dad.
FRANK: What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?
GEORGE: What are you doing here?
KRAMER: Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
JERRY: Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
KRAMER: Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
FRANK: Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
(Frank storms out of the apartment.)
KRAMER: What's the matter with him?
GEORGE: My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
KRAMER: Shell-shocked?
GEORGE: Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
[Elaine is wrapping up a meeting at Peterman's.]
ELAINE: That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
EDDIE: Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.
ELAINE: Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
EDDIE: I'm ready.
ELAINE: Oh, okay.
EDDIT: (reading) It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.
[Elaine and Jerry are at the coffee shop.]
ELAINE: What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
JERRY: Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
ELAINE: You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
[George is taking an eye exam.]
GEORGE: Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this insurance form, here's a pen.
(George reaches for the pen and grabs the Doctor's face.)
GEORGE: You're a very handsome man, by the way.
[Jerry walks into his apartment; there are pots and pans bubbling on the stove.]
JERRY: What the hell is going on here?
(Kramer comes running in holding a scalding pot full of dumplings, he drops the pot into the sink and cools his burnt fingers.)
JERRY: What are you doing?
KRAMER: I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
JERRY: No, I don't want to.
KRAMER: Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.
(Jerry gabs a fork and tastes a piece.)
KRAMER: Hah?
JERRY: Oh, this is awful.
KRAMER: Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
(Kramer bites into one and spits it out.)
JERRY: Did you follow the recipe?
KRAMER: The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
JERRY: It tastes like dirt.
KRAMER: Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
JERRY: Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
KRAMER: No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
(Abby walks in.)
ABBY: I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.
KRAMER: My stuffed cabbage!
(Kramer runs out.)
ABBY: So, great dinner last night.
JERRY: Yeah, it was alright.
ABBY: I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Bania Saturday and then catch his act.
JERRY: No. No, no way, no Bania.
ABBY: What?
JERRY: Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
ABBY: Cynthia would not date a hack.
JERRY: Would. Does. Is.
[Elaine is chairing a meeting at Peterman's.]
ELAINE: Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
(There are general remarks of relief from the meeting attendees.)
ELAINE: He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
EMPLOYEE: You promoted him?
ELAINE: Well, no, I would hardly--
EMPLOYEE: I bust my hump ever day.
ELAINE: Relax--
EMPLOYEE: As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protégé can run the catalog by yourselves! I quit!
(What follows is a chorus of "me too"s and "I'm with him"s as everybody walks out.)
ELAINE: Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
[George is in his office at Yankee stadium, he pushes 'play' on a cassette recorder. The voice on the tape sounds exactly like George.]
VOICE: Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?
GEORGE: This guy sounds just like me.
VOICE: To understand risk, we must first define risk.
GEORGE: This is horrible.
VOICE: Risk is defined as--
GEORGE: (banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
[Kramer is at Frank's.]
KRAMER: C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
FRANK: In my mind, there's a war still going on.
KRAMER: Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
(Frank pours a shot of whiskey and drinks it.)
FRANK: Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right spices, cooked it long enough...
KRAMER: What happened?
FRANK: I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men to the latrines that night. They were just boys.
KRAMER: Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
FRANK: Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!
KRAMER: Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
FRANK: No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get out. Go.
[Jerry and Abby are in Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: So you saw Bania's act?
ABBY: He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it anymore.
JERRY: I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
ABBY: Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?
JERRY: He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
ABBY: Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think it's over.
JERRY: No more mentor?
ABBY: Looks that way.
JERRY: Well at least you and I are okay again.
ABBY: Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while.
JERRY: Why?
ABBY: Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to have an advisor.
JERRY: I can tell you what to do.
ABBY: No, it's more than that.
JERRY: I can tell you what to think.
ABBY: I need someone I can trust.
JERRY: Oh.
(George busts in.)
GEORGE: I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
JERRY: Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
(George shuts up and relaxes on the couch.)
JERRY: George?
ABBY: I gotta run anyway.
JERRY: I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
ABBY: I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.
JERRY: Yeah, see ya.
(Abby leaves and George gets up and runs out the door after her.)
JERRY: What's your problem.
(George runs back.)
GEORGE: No problem.
(George runs away again.)
[Elaine and Eddie Sherman are alone in the office working on writing copy.]
EDDIE: Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.
ELAINE: Oh.
EDDIE: (reading) It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a skull.
ELAINE: You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
EDDIE: Well, I'm not married to it.
Elaine. Oh. Well, um, in that case why don't we take the phrase, "kicking in a skull" and we tweak it, you know, just a hair, to something like, what, like "strolling through a dewy meadow"?
EDDIE: Dewy meadow.
[Frank and Estelle are in their kitchen.]
ESTELLE: Here's your omelet.
FRANK: It's dry.
ESTELLE: That's the way I always make it.
FRANK: Well it sucks.
ESTELLE: What did you say?
FRANK: Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!
ESTELLE: Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!
FRANK: Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
[George and Abby are at George's office.]
ABBY: And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a protégé?
GEORGE: I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
ABBY: I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.
GEORGE: I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
ABBY: Alright.
GEORGE: Okay.
[Jerry runs into Bania on a street corner.]
BANIA: Hey Jerry.
JERRY: Oh, hey Bania.
BANIA: Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.
JERRY: Oh, that's too bad.
BANIA: Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. The worst, Jerry.
JERRY: Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestlé's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
BANIA: You think you can give me a hand with my material?
[Frank is knocking on Kramer's door.]
KRAMER: Hey.
FRANK: You still need a cook?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.
FRANK: Ya got T-Fal?
KRAMER: Keflon.
FRANK: No! Follow me.
[Jerry is reviewing material with Bania.]
BANIA: (reading) Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
[Elaine is reviewing copy with Eddie.]
ELAINE: Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
[Jerry and Abby are at Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: George Costanza is your mentor?
ABBY: Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.
(Abby places her risk management folder on the table.)
JERRY: About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
ABBY: You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the mentor/mentor relationship.
JERRY: As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protégé of my own.
(Jerry places his Bania folder on the table.)
ABBY: Who?
JERRY: A Mister Kenneth Bania.
ABBY: Bania?
JERRY: I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
ABBY: Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protégé is a hack.
(Abby picks up a folder and puts it in her bag.)
JERRY: Well, I don't think I want to date a protégé whose mentor is a Costanza.
[Elaine and Eddie are sharing chocolate shakes at the coffee shop.]
ELAINE: I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
EDDIE: Cool.
ELAINE: Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
EDDIE: I don't want to talk about it.
ELAINE: Come on, don't be a baby.
EDDIE: I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.
ELAINE: That's it?
EDDIE: Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.
["Jewish Singles Night".]
ELAINE: Mm. This food is fantastic.
JERRY: Have you tried the hamentashen?
ELAINE: I can't get off the kishkas.
BANIA: Hey Jerry!
JERRY: Bania?
BANIA: I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote for me? It's killer!
JERRY: Risk management?
BANIA: Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back.
(Cut to a woman talking with Eddie Sherman.)
WOMAN: So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development in two days?
EDDIE: That's right.
WOMAN: How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
(Cut to Kramer and Frank behind a table loaded with 'Jewish delicacies'.)
KRAMER: Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
FRANK: Where's the powdered sugar?
KRAMER: You know Frank, you could take a break.
FRANK: No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
(Cut to Eddie breaking the news to Elaine.)
ELAINE: You're quitting?
EDDIE: I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.
ELAINE: Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
(Elaine grabs Eddie by the lapels and shakes him, Eddie chokes on a piece of bread. Frank sees this and flashes back to Korea. He runs around the room knocking plates to the floor and when Kramer tries to stop him, he heads to the loaded down table and starts to tip it over. The scene ends in mid-tip.)
[George is prepared to give his speech at the Yankees meeting.]
VOICE: Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.
(George steps up and opens his folder.)
GEORGE: Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
(George flips through a few pages.)
GEORGE: They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
WILHELM: (proudly, to the man seated beside him): He's my protégé.
FRANK: Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!"
[Street]
(Jerry and Elaine come out of a drugstore. Elaine has a couple of carrier bags she's fussing with the contents of.)
JERRY: Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
ELAINE: Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
JERRY: Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
(Jerry and Elaine begin to walk along the street.)
ELAINE: What is this, a 'bit'?
JERRY: No.
ELAINE: 'Cos I'm not in the mood.
JERRY: We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
ELAINE: Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
JERRY: They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
ELAINE: (tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
JERRY: (hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
ELAINE: It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
JERRY: (thinking) Great. Thanks.
[Some Fancy Place]
(The room is stylishly furnished. A number of people sit around, chatting and drinking. Elaine and her new boyfriend, Brett, walk across the room, carrying drinks.)
ELAINE: So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
BRETT: We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
(Elaine and Brett sit on a couch)
ELAINE: (as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.
BRETT: You know Farbman?
ELAINE: Mm, love Farbman.
BRETT: Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.
ELAINE: Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
(Music begins to play. It's The Eagles' Desperado. Brett hears the music and is enraptured. He stares off into the distance, oblivious to everything but the song.)
ELAINE: Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
(Brett hasn't heard a word of what Elaine said, continuing to stare off into the distance.)
ELAINE: Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
(Brett still doesn't react.)
ELAINE: Brett?
BRETT: (still staring off) After the song, babe.
ELAINE: Huh?
BRETT: The song.
(Elaine stares at Brett and puts a hand to her chest, moved by his sensitivity.)
[Street]
(Jerry and Elaine come round the corner, past the Chinese restaurant and walk along the street.)
JERRY: So when do I meet this jerk?
ELAINE: He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
JERRY: Who?
ELAINE: (dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
JERRY: What song?
ELAINE: Desperado.
JERRY: Desperado?
ELAINE: Uh huh.
JERRY: And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
(Ahead of the strolling twosome, a guy stands on the sidewalk, twirling a brightly-coloured umbrella over his shoulder.)
JERRY: (pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
ELAINE: Uh huh.
JERRY: I invented that.
ELAINE: That, had to be invented?
JERRY: When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
(Elaine folds her arms, unconvinced.)
ELAINE: (skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
(Elaine marches toward the umbrella guy.)
JERRY: Elaine.
ELAINE: Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
JERRY: Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
CLICKY: Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.
ELAINE: (looking at Jerry) Ohh.
JERRY: I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
CLICKY: Yeah, that's where he come up with it.
JERRY: In his dreams.
ELAINE: Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
(Elaine walks off, crossing the street. Jerry follows.)
JERRY: (to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is demonstrating twirling an umbrella to George, who sits in a chair with a magazine.)
JERRY: It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
GEORGE: (pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
JERRY: (as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
(Jerry tosses his umbrella onto the couch, and walks toward the kitchen. The door opens and Kramer enters, carrying a large envelope.)
KRAMER: Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
JERRY: (taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
GEORGE: What checks?
KRAMER: Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
JERRY: I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
KRAMER: Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
JERRY: (opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
GEORGE: Look at all of those! You're rich!
JERRY: Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
(Kramer sits on the couch and flinches as he sits on the umbrella. He reaches under himself and extracts it, then jumps again as he accidentally opens it. He gets back up, and heads to the kitchen.)
KRAMER: Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: (getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
(George wanders over.)
GEORGE: He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
JERRY: Ah, who are any of her losers?
GEORGE: (dryly) You're on that list.
(George goes and gets his coat.)
GEORGE: Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
KRAMER: Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
EGO: Yeah, you heard of 'em?
KRAMER: They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
GEORGE: So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
JERRY: I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
[Street]
(Kramer and Jerry stroll along. Jerry is massaging his left hand, as if it's giving him discomfort.)
JERRY: Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
KRAMER: Hello, twelve dollars.
(Jerry and Kramer draw level with three Japanese tourists. One of them steps forward, holding out a camera.)
MR OH: Excuse me. Would you take picture please?
KRAMER: (takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.
(Jerry has spotted something further along the street. It's another umbrella salesman, twirling his wares.)
JERRY: I'm gonna ask this guy something.
(Jerry walks along to the guy. Kramer fusses about, taking a picture of the three Japanese guys, at one point he steps back to frame them all, and stumbles off the curb.)
JERRY: (to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
(Back down the street, Kramer has finished photographing. He looks over toward Jerry, and thinks for a second.)
KRAMER: (to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
MR YAMAGUCHI: Hai.
MR OH: Yes.
KRAMER: (points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
(Jerry has taken one of the umbrellas, and is demonstrating the twirl to the guy. He's speaking animatedly, with lots of hand gestures and arm waving.)
KRAMER: That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
MR OH: Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...
(The three guys all speak to each other in excited Japanese.)
KRAMER: Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
(Kramer and the three guys look along to where Jerry is still talking vigorously to the umbrella guy.)
MR OH: What is he doing?
KRAMER: Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
MR OH: He's funny.
KRAMER: Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
(Jerry is tossing the umbrella from hand to hand, with the unimpressed guy watching him. Kramer laughs, and the Japanese all join in.)
KRAMER: Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
(Kramer and the Japanese all laugh uproariously, watching Jerry.)
[George's Apartment]
(Three guys in bright yellow overalls stand in George's living room. Two of them have a large carpet cleaner by the door, ready to leave, The third, the leader, has a notebook.)
CREW LEADER: (calling to George) We're pretty much finished.
(George enters from another room.)
CREW LEADER: There's just one more thing.
GEORGE: (smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
(The leader opens his book and holds up a check.)
CREW LEADER: (clears throat) You forgot to sign your check.
(The leader hands George a pen, and waits as George appends his signature.)
GEORGE: (signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
CREW LEADER: (flat) No.
(The carpet cleaners begin to leave. George follows the leader toward the door, looking disappointed.)
GEORGE: (let down) So, that's it?
CREW LEADER: Unless you need a receipt.
GEORGE: (melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
CREW LEADER: (flat) Good luck with that.
(The leader closes the door on a perplexed George.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry sits at his table. He's signing checks, and holding his pen awkwardly in his hand which is twisted uncomfortably. Elaine enters and notices his hand.)
JERRY: Hey.
ELAINE: What's with the claw?
JERRY: Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
(Elaine wanders toward the kitchen. The door opens and Brett enters.)
BRETT: (to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer.
ELAINE: Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.
JERRY: Hi.
(Jerry holds up his twisted hand in greeting. Brett copies the position of the fingers in his wave back.)
BRETT: That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.
JERRY: Ah, I'm one kind.
(Elaine gets a bottle of water form the fridge.)
ELAINE: Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
JERRY: The Fleckman.
BRETT: Farbman.
JERRY: Right.
ELAINE: You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
JERRY: (not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.
BRETT: I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.
JERRY: No. I'm fine, thank you.
BRETT: Don't worry. It's no charge to you.
(Brett walks over past Jerry and points to Jerry's desk.)
BRETT: Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your skits.
JERRY: (quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
BRETT: (walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.
ELAINE: Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
BRETT: (quiet) Oops.
(Brett looks round at Jerry, seeming embarrassed.)
BRETT: Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should get going.
(Brett opens the door.)
ELAINE: Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?
JERRY: Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
BRETT: (scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.
JERRY: You look like you could use a...
ELAINE: (warning) Jerry.
[Saks]
(Kramer and the Japanese tourists are looking at stuff. Kramer picks up a Stetson and reads the price tag.)
KRAMER: (reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
(Kramer holds the hat over, so Mr Oh can get a look.)
MR OH: (thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.
KRAMER: (shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
(Kramer places the hat on an unsure Mr Oh's head.)
KRAMER: Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
(Kramer hands Stetsons to each of the other Japanese.)
[Brett's Car]
(Brett and Elaine sit in his parked two seat Ferrari.)
BRETT: I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer that chest of drawers, isn't he?
ELAINE: Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
BRETT: How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.
ELAINE: (romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
BRETT: (smiling) I hope not.
(Brett leans across to kiss Elaine. Just as they begin to kiss, the Eagles' Desperado comes on the radio. Brett immediately breaks off the kiss, and stares off into the distance again.)
ELAINE: (surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
(Brett makes no response.)
ELAINE: (worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
BRETT: Elaine, the song.
ELAINE: (relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
BRETT: Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?
ELAINE: (apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
(Elaine stares queryingly at the rapt Brett.)
[Monk's]
(Jerry and George sit in a booth, sipping coffee.)
JERRY: No spiel?
GEORGE: (annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
JERRY: So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
GEORGE: They could've at least tried!
JERRY: You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
GEORGE: Please.
JERRY: Too dumb?
(George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters, wearing a snazzy new suit. He strolls over to the booth.)
JERRY: (impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
KRAMER: Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
JERRY: Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
KRAMER: Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
(Jerry looks puzzled.)
KRAMER: That's right.
GEORGE: How'd you hook up with these guys?
KRAMER: Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
JERRY: What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
KRAMER: (to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
GEORGE: (excited) Yeah, the pilot!
KRAMER: That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
GEORGE: (enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
JERRY: Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
GEORGE: (animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
(Jerry looks doubtful.)
KRAMER: George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
(Jerry looks at George, wondering.)
[Japanese TV Office]
(Jerry and George sit on a couch. Two Japanese TV executives, one male, one female, sit on chairs. They are all watching the pilot show Jerry made at the end of Season 4. The Japanese are not looking impressed. George is smiling and pointing, enthusiastically. On a coffee table sits a large bowl containing a plastic bag of oranges.)
TV JERRY: You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go out with my butler?!
TV ELAINE: Well, why do I need your permission?
TV JERRY: Because he's my butler.
(The first executive stops the tape.)
GEORGE: (eager) So? What d'you think?
EXECUTIVE 1: We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?
GEORGE: Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
EXECUTIVE 1: Is this customary in your legal system?
JERRY: No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Are you following any of this?
EXECUTIVE 2: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: I'm still trying to figure out why they gave us a bag of oranges.
EXECUTIVE 1: (to Jerry and George) I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.
GEORGE: Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
(Jerry nods, sagely, and picks up a cup of coffee. His fingers are still twisted from the check signing.)
EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Again with the oranges
(There's a crash as Jerry's grip on the cup fails and he drops it.)
JERRY: (flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
GEORGE: (positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
EXECUTIVE 1: You must go now.
(Jerry pats George on the knee. George squeezes Jerry's shoulder and they ruefully begin to depart. )
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry sits at his table, signing yet more checks, the pen gripped in his clawed fingers. Elaine stands in her jacket, her bag on the table.)
ELAINE: Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
JERRY: (throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
ELAINE: He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
JERRY: You know, what you need is a song you can share.
ELAINE: Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
JERRY: Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
(Elaine tips back her head and thinks for a second, before something occurs.)
ELAINE: (points) I like Witchy Woman.
JERRY: Witchy Woman?
ELAINE: You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
JERRY: (getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
(The door opens and Kramer enters, wearing his suit and carrying another fat envelope.)
KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey, man.
ELAINE: Hey.
(Kramer puts the envelope down on the table next to Jerry. Elaine walks to the kitchen.)
JERRY: Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
KRAMER: Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
JERRY: Ah.
KRAMER: Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
JERRY: What for?
(Kramer wanders into Jerry's bedroom.)
KRAMER (O.C.): Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.
JERRY: I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
(Kramer reenters, carrying three pillows.)
KRAMER: Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
JERRY: Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
KRAMER: Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
(Elaine is in the kitchen, eating cereal from the box.)
ELAINE: Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
KRAMER: Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
ELAINE: In them?!
JERRY: You have them sleeping in drawers?!
KRAMER: Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
JERRY: This has 'international incident' written all over it.
KRAMER: (smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Up against one wall of the apartment stands a very large chest of three drawers. It's about six feet long and each drawers is maybe a foot and a half deep. Kramer walks over to it and looks into the open top drawer.)
KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
(One of the Japanese tourists sits up in the drawer.)
MR TANAKA: Goodnight.
(Mr Tanaka lies down again, and Kramer slides the drawer shut. He then speaks to the occupant of the next drawer.)
KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Oh.
MR OH: (sits up) Goodnight.
(Mr Oh lies back down and Kramer slides the drawers shut, and speaks to the final drawer's occupant.)
KRAMER: Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.
MR YAMAGUCHI: (sits up) Oyasuminasai *(Japanese for goodnight)
(Mr Yamaguchi lies down. Kramer shuts the final drawer, switches off the lamp and, yawning, walks off toward his own bed)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Kramer is in the kitchen. He has three bowls out on the counter, and a box of Rice Crispies. Jerry walks over, pushing a bunch of checks into an envelope.)
JERRY: What is this?
KRAMER: Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.
JERRY: Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
KRAMER: (opening the fridge) Sayonara.
JERRY: (leaving) Konichi-wa.
(Kramer fetches out milk and continues making breakfast.)
[Brett's Car]
(Elaine and Brett sit in the parked Ferrari. Witchy Woman is playing on the stereo. Elaine is listening, with her eyes closed and her head nodding. Brett looks puzzled.)
BRETT: Elaine, I...
ELAINE: Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
(Elaine continues to listen. Brett leans forward and switches off the music.)
ELAINE: What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
BRETT: Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.
ELAINE: Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
BRETT: (flat) No. It's mine.
(There is a flash of lightning and thunder rolls. Elaine peers out at the weather.)
[Kramer's Apartment]
(The top and bottom drawers are open in the chest. Mr Yamaguchi sits up in the bottom drawer, and Mr Tanaka sits on top of the chest, with his feet in his drawer. Kramer comes over and hands bowls of Rice Crispies to the pair of them.)
KRAMER: Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
(Kramer leans over and raps on the face of the middle drawer.)
KRAMER: (loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
MR OH (O.C.): Ach, come back in half hour.
(Kramer looks impatient. He puts the bowl of Rice Crispies on top of the chest and walks off mumbling irritably.)
[Street]
(It is pouring with rain. Jerry walks along the street, wearing just a light jacket over his clothes. He still has the envelope in his hands. Jerry spots the umbrella vendor, twirling his wares.)
JERRY: (calls) Hey, I'll take one.
CLICKY: Well, look who's back!
(Clicky turns to another umbrella seller,who is facing the other way.)
CLICKY: Teddy! (indicates Jerry) This's the guy says he invented the twirl.
TEDDY: (unfriendly recognition) Jerry Seinfeld!
JERRY: Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
TEDDY: (bitter) Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago.
JERRY: Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
TEDDY: (angry) Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of eighty-four? I almost lost my house.
(A guy comes along the street, wearing one of Elaine's urban sombreros. Clicky tries to catch his attention.)
CLICKY: Umbrella, buddy?
(The sombrero wearer waves away the attention and crosses the street.)
CLICKY: Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.
TEDDY: (to Clicky) Easy, there. (to Jerry) I hear you're taking credit for the twirl.
JERRY: Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
TEDDY: (intense) I care. Clicky cares.
JERRY: So, could I...
(Another peal of thunder rolls as interruption.)
JERRY: Could I just buy an umbrella?
TEDDY: (sour) Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.
JERRY: (shock) What?!
TEDDY: (caustically) Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.
(The rain continues to pour down unabated.)
[George's Office, Yankee Stadium]
(George is removing a tape from a VCR. Kramer enters, followed by the three Japanese tourists. Outside the window, the rain can be seen bucketing down.)
KRAMER: Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
GEORGE: (indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
KRAMER: (quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
(George thinks for a minute, then looks down at the tape in his hands.)
GEORGE: Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
KRAMER: (snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
(The Japanese nod to each other.)
MR OH: But, we are also very hungry.
KRAMER: Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
(Kramer and George wave the Japanese toward seats. Kramer leaves the office and looks down the corridor. He raises his arm to attract attention.)
KRAMER: (shouts) Hey, peanuts!
(As the Japanese sit, Mr Wilhelm comes to the door.)
WILHELM: George. (waves George over) George.
(George goes out into the hall with Wilhelm.)
WILHELM: (puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?
GEORGE: Are they here?
WILHELM: They're in my office, right now.
GEORGE: (suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
WILHELM: About what?
GEORGE: (to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
[Street]
(Jerry walks along. He is still carrying the envelope of checks, and by now he's drenched. A familiar red Ferrari pulls to a stop level with Jerry, and the window winds down.)
BRETT: (calls over) Hey Jerry!
(Jerry peers at the car and walks out into the road as he recognises Brett.)
JERRY: Oh, hi Brett.
BRETT: Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?
JERRY: Ah, I didn't have enough money.
BRETT: I'm sure things'll pick up for you.
JERRY: No, it's not that, it's the...
(Jerry looks down at the envelope of checks in his hands. The rain has soaked them so thoroughly that the ink of his signatures has run and become illegible.)
JERRY: Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
(Brett peers over at the mass of sodden paper in Jerry's grip.)
BRETT: Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents?
JERRY: No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
BRETT: Nothing's working for you, is is?
JERRY: (bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.
BRETT: I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.
(Beside Brett sits a bald-headed, bearded, guy in shades.)
JERRY: (sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
(Jerry walks away)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is drying the checks. Dozens hang from lines around the apartment, and more sit on the table, where Jerry dabs them with a towel.)
ELAINE: Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
JERRY: Boogeyman.
ELAINE: Boogey?
JERRY: I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
ELAINE: No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
JERRY: (negative) Eehh.
ELAINE: (desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
(Elaine puts he hand to her head, walks round the room and flops onto the couch. The door opens and George enters. He's in buoyant mood.)
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: (excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
JERRY: Really? They bought the butler character?
GEORGE: (excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
JERRY: NBC?
GEORGE: (little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
(Elaine looks heavenwards.)
JERRY: Ah. But they told us we must go now.
GEORGE: But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
(George opens the door. Jerry comes over before he can leave.)
JERRY: Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
(George smiles, claps Jerry on the shoulder and leaves. Jerry starts to close the door, but George turns back)
GEORGE: Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
JERRY: Who?
GEORGE: The network executive. You think she liked me?
(Jerry swings the door closed in George's face.)
[Hallway]
(George crosses the hall to Kramer's door. He knocks, but there is no immediate reply. George listens, and can hear excited shouting and laughter. He opens the door and goes in)
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Kramer and the three Japanese sit in the hot-tub. They're stripped to the waist (at least), wearing Stetsons, and drinking sake. They spot George as he enters and shout greetings.)
KRAMER: Heyy! Look who's here.
(The Japanese whoop and wave at George.)
KRAMER: (beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
(All the Japanese gesture and shout that George should get in the tub with them.)
MR OH: Come on in, fat boy!
(George waves away their appeals with a smile.)
GEORGE: Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
(Kramer and the Japanese cheer and splash water at George, who leaves. Then they go back to knocking back sake.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is re-signing all the checks he dried out.)
JERRY: (to himself) Last one.
(Jerry completes his signature and drops the pen from his claw-like hand. It's clearly painful.)
JERRY: (agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
[Street]
(George stands outside the Nakahama Broadcast Corp offices. He's waiting for someone. Kramer wanders up behind him and speaks into George's ear.)
KRAMER: There you are.
(George jumps, surprised by Kramer.)
GEORGE: Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
KRAMER: Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
(Kramer reaches into his pocket and pulls out a number of airline tickets.)
KRAMER: I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
GEORGE: (horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
KRAMER: No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
(A panicky George rushes toward a payphone.)
GEORGE: (frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
[Street/Jerry's Apartment]
(Jerry is bathing his crippled left hand in a bowl of ice-water. The phone rings and he picks up (with his right).)
JERRY: Yeah?
GEORGE: (panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
JERRY: (kidding) Uncle Leo?
GEORGE: (scream) Jerry!!
(George begins hammering the phone against the kiosk. Jerry lifts the phone away from his ear at the noise.)
JERRY: Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
(Jerry hangs up the phone.)
JERRY: (to himself) Hmm, testy.
[Kramer's Apartment]
(The chest of drawers still stands against one wall. All the drawers are shut, and from within them can be heard thumping noises and cries for help. Jerry enters and hears the calls.)
JERRY: Hello?
MR OH (O.C.): Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!
(Jerry pulls at the handle with his good hand, but it won't move. He tries to hook his bad hand round the other handle and pull.)
JERRY: It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
MR OH (O.C.): Pull harder.
JERRY: I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
MR OH (O.C): Very funny, but no joking, please.
JERRY: (looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
[Hallway]
(Elaine and Brett stroll up to Jerry's door. Brett is carrying an umbrella. Elaine looks dubious.)
ELAINE: Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
BRETT: Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.
ELAINE: Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
(Elaine reaches for Jerry's doorhandle, but a shout from Kramer's apartment distracts her.)
JERRY (O.C.): (yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
(Elaine moves to enter Kramer's apartment.)
ELAINE: Jerry?
[Kramer's Apartment]
(Elaine enters followed by Brett.)
ELAINE: Jerry.
(Jerry stands in front of the chest of drawers, holding a large fireman's axe. He swings it high and smashes it into the top of the chest, the wood splintering under the impact. Brett looks horrified. He drops the umbrella, and rushes forward to protect the furniture.)
BRETT: (shouting) Not the Farbman!!
(Elaine stares after the charging Brett. She puts her hand to her mouth and screams, horrified at what she sees.)
[Japanese TV Office]
(The Japanese tourists sit on the couch, looking like survivors of some horrible ordeal, with the two executives in their chairs. George perches on the arm of the couch).
MR OH: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe.
EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We suspect his friend here is also unbalanced.
(The tourists turn slowly and look nervously at the smiling, uncomprehending, George.)
GEORGE: So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
MR OH: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Could we have a couple of those oranges?
(The executives gesture their assent. The tourists eagerly grab the fruit.)
MR OH: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We are very hungry and have survived many hardships.
(Behind the couch, two of the carpet cleaner people enter, including the leader. They walk over to a corner. George notices them and stands.)
GEORGE: (to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
EXECUTIVE 1: Yes. Cleaned up the (points) coffee stain, left by Jerry Seinfield.
(Wilhelm enters, dressed in the same yellow overall as the other carpet cleaners. George looks stunned.)
GEORGE: Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
WILHELM: I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning.
(George lets this sink in, then slowly turns to the leader.)
GEORGE: (incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
(The leader shrugs, as if to say 'You work it out.')
GEORGE: (urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
WILHELM: Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
(George purses his lips.)
EXECUTIVE 1: (speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: With these two idiots I don't know how the Yankees won the World Series.
(The second executive shakes her head.)
[Jerry's Apartment]
(Brett sits next to Jerry's table, looking dazed. Elaine stands beside him, applying an icepack to his temple. Jerry stands opposite Eaine.)
JERRY: (apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
(Elaine gives Jerry a look.)
JERRY: (defensive) At least it was just the handle!
BRETT: It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
(Brett looks concerned.)
BRETT: I can't remember his name!
JERRY: Fleckman?
ELAINE: Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
ELAINE/JERRY: (singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you, before it's too...'
(Brett slips out from under the icepack and falls face-first onto the table with an audible clunk. Elaine looks down, shocked. Jerry just looks down.)
[Insert]
(An ambulance races through the streets of New York, siren wailing.)
[Emergency Room]
(Brett lays on his back, as a doctor and nurse examine him.)
NURSE: His pulse is fine.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to relieve the swelling.
(Music begins to play. It's Witchy Woman, and the doctor gets the same look on his face as Brett with Desperado. He looks off into the distance.)
NURSE: Doctor?
(The doctor stares away.)
NURSE: (concerned) Doctor?
(The doctor is oblivious to the nurse.)
NURSE: (worried) Doctor?
(There is still no response from the doctor.)
NURSE: (alarm) Doctor, I think we're losing him!
(As the doctor stares off into the distance, the monitoring instruments can be heard beeping faster and faster.)
[George and Jerry are on the side of the street at a fruit stand / market. George picks up a bottle of Orange juice.]
GEORGE: Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
JERRY: I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
GEORGE: Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
JERRY: Restaurants too?
GEORGE: Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
JERRY: Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole.
(George asks the store worker a question)
GEORGE: Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?
WORKER: Dollar nineteen.
GEORGE: I'll give you a quarter.
WORKER: Get the hell out of here.
JERRY: Tell him forty and no fork.
GEORGE: Thirty.
WORKER: That's it you leave and never come back!
JERRY: How about we leave and, come back in a week?
WORKER: Deal! (turns and walks into the market)
GEORGE: Alright see? We got something there.
[Kramer and Jerry and on the side of the street talking about the new chicken shack.]
KRAMER: Awe check it out.
JERRY: Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
KRAMER: Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
JERRY: He is the gambler.
KRAMER: Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
JERRY: Try and stay calm.
KRAMER: Yea, yea.
(Kramer exits)
[Man on street recognizes Jerry.]
MAN: Hey Jerry.
JERRY: Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
SETH: At least.
JERRY: You wanna grab lunch?
SETH: Ah, I'm actually headed back to the office.
JERRY: Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
SETH: Well I am, supposed to be in this meeting.
JERRY: Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
SETH & JERRY: Alright, alright.
JERRY: Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
SETH: He's dead.
JERRY: Is that right?
(Jerry and Seth walk off down the sidewalk)
[George and Elaine are in a store]
GEORGE: You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
ELAINE: What do you think of the catalog?
GEORGE: It stinks.
ELAINE: There, we just talked business.
SALES WOMAN: We do have the down comforter and the cookware you liked.
ELAINE: Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
SALES WOMAN: You know what else we have that you might like?
ELAINE: I'll take it.
(George puts on a giant Russian hat)
GEORGE: Hey, you like?
(Elaine laughs)
SALES WOMAN: I think it looks very nice on you.
GEORGE: Really? (feeling flattered)
SALES WOMAN: Hmm.
GEORGE: Elaine, huh... Peterman account?
ELAINE: Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
(George takes off the hat.)
[Jerry and Seth are eating at a restaurant]
SETH: So how's your stand up career?
JERRY: Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
SETH: Do you speak Japanese?
JERRY: No
SETH: So you would have done it in Japan, but in English.
(Jerry thinks for a minute)
JERRY: I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
SETH: Big investment firm.
JERRY: Mmmm.
SETH: We just got the Citibank account. In fact today was our first big meeting with them.
JERRY: The, the meeting you blew off?
(Seth laughs)
SETH: Yea.
JERRY: Wasn't that kind of important?
(Seth pauses to think, and then gets worried.)
SETH: Yea.
[Jerry and Elaine are talking on the phone]
ELAINE: ...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
JERRY: You use a Water Pik?
ELAINE: Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.
JERRY: So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
ELAINE: Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
(Elaine clicks over to the call waiting, putting Jerry on hold in the process. The screen is a 3 panel shot -- Ipswitch, Elaine, Jerry )
ELAINE: Hello?
MAN: Good day Ms. Benes. It's Roger Ipswitch.
ELAINE: Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
ROGER: Ms. Benes, I notice you've been charging quite a bit of merchandise on the Peterman account.
(Jerry looks at his shirt)
ELAINE: Well, I am the President.
ROGER: Yes, and we're all very impressed. Never the less, the expense account is for business purposes only.
ELAINE: Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
ROGER: No. I'll be in your office first thing tomorrow. Good day. (hangs up the phone)
(screen still has 3 panels, but Ipswitch's panel is now black, leaving Elaine and Jerry in their own panels)
ELAINE: Good day.
(Elaine hangs up - her panel goes black, leaving Jerry still on hold)
JERRY: Hello. Anybody?
[George walks into Monks wearing the Russian hat.]
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
GEORGE: This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
JERRY: I don't believe it.
(George takes off hat and sits in booth)
GEORGE: Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
JERRY: Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
GEORGE: I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
JERRY: That's a date?
GEORGE: What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, you're hummin' it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
JERRY: How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
GEORGE: If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
JERRY: That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
[Jerry is at his apartment door]
JERRY: (sings theme) "By Mennen."  What the?...
(Jerry notices a red dot on his door, Using his hand, he traces the red light coming from Kramer's peep hole. Jerry knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer opens the door -- a huge red light is flooding the apartment as well as a pronounced buzzing sound. Kramer is smoking away on a cigar. Jerry is taken-a-back by the bright red light.)
JERRY: What's going on in there?
KRAMER: What?
JERRY: That light!
KRAMER: Oh the red. Yeah, It's the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
JERRY: Can't you shut the shades?
KRAMER: They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
JERRY: Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?
KRAMER: Yeah, he was fired.
[Elaine's office, Elaine is trying to convince the accounting guy that all of her expenses are business related]
ELAINE: Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
ROGER: Another bulls eye.
ELAINE: Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
(Elaine turns on Water Pik to water the plants.)
ROGER: I just need to see the sable hat you purchased yesterday.
ELAINE: The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
ROGER: It costs eight-thousand dollars.
ELAINE: What?
(Elaine, surprised at the cost of the hat, turns and accidentally hits Roger with water from Water Pik -- he tries to block the water stream from hitting him.)
ELAINE: Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
[Jerry is talking to Seth at his apartment]
JERRY: Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
SETH: We're old college buddies.
JERRY: I only knew you through Moochie.
SETH: Hey Jerry don't worry about it all right. The important thing is, is we got to catch up. Mind if I ah, grab the want ads?
JERRY: Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
(Exit Seth. Kramer comes over, walks into the doorjam. Red light still blaring)
JERRY: How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
KRAMER: Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
JERRY: Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
KRAMER: Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
(Kramer takes a pitcher of red liquid from the fridge and pours it on his cereal.)
JERRY: What are you doing?
KRAMER: Getting some cereal
JERRY: That, that's tomato juice.
(Kramer takes a big spoonful of cereal with tomato juice!)
(Spits out cereal)
KRAMER: That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
(Kramer takes the bowl to the trash can and proceeds to spill the cereal and tomato juice all over Jerry's wall in the area around the trash can)
JERRY: I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
(Kramer attempts to cleans the mess with a dish rag....)
JERRY: ..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
(Squeezes juice from rag into pitcher and puts it back in the fridge)
KRAMER: Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
JERRY: Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
KRAMER: Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
JERRY: Yea, that's no good.
KRAMER: I may have to drive that place out of business.
JERRY: How you gonna do that?
KRAMER: Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
(Kramer makes a peace sign and a pop noise.)
(Kramer opens door and leans way back from the overwhelming red neon light )
[George is dropping off the sales woman that sold him the hat.]
HEATHER: Thanks George, but I got it from here.
GEORGE: Oh no I'm in already come on.
(George puts down the bags he came in with)
GEORGE: So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
HEATHER: No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.
GEORGE: What about this weekend?
HEATHER: I'm gonna be busy for a while.
GEORGE: OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
HEATHER: Hey, you forgot your keys.
GEORGE: Oh, those, those aren't my keys.
HEATHER: Well they're not mine.
GEORGE: Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
(Phone rings)
HEATHER: Goodbye George.
GEORGE: Yea bye.
HEATHER: George, Bye! (picks up phone) Hello? You are not going to believe the date I just had.
(George places his hat on her chair, behind a pillow. )
GEORGE: (sings) Co-stan-za. (like "By Mennen")
(Heather turns and looks as the door shuts)
[George and Elaine are in Elaine's office. George is looking at a bunch of fake butterflies on the wall]
ELAINE: What do you mean you don't have the hat?
GEORGE: I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
ELAINE: No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
GEORGE: Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
(George tries to dial but gets a busy tone)
ELAINE: Dial 9- MERLIN.
(George dials again on speaker phone and Heather answers)
HEATHER: Hello?
GEORGE: (clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
HEATHER: Oy!
GEORGE: Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
HEATHER: You didn't' leave a hat here.
GEORGE: I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
HEATHER: No hat. George I gotta go.
GEORGE: Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, y'ummm (stammering)
(Heather hangs up)
[Jerry is walking down the street and sees Seth emptying a garbage for Kenny Rogers Roasters]
JERRY: Seth?
SETH: Jerry Hi! What do you think?
JERRY: I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
SETH: Yeah, I'm the new manager
JERRY: But your were an executive, this is fast food.
SETH: Not fast food, good food quickly. Hey, next time lunch'll be on me, huh Jer.
(Kramer opens his window revealing a banner saying "BAD CHICKEN")
KRAMER: Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
SETH: That's not going to be good for business.
JERRY: That's not going to be good for anybody.
[Kramer and Jerry are talking in Jerry's apartment.]
KRAMER: Jerry I'm so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
JERRY: Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
KRAMER: What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
JERRY: And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
(Jerry is interrupted by the sound of a toilet flush, out comes Newman from the bathroom who then tosses a newspaper on the table)
JERRY: Oh no.
NEWMAN: Nice place you got here Kramer ...
KRAMER: Yeah.
NEWMAN: ... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)
JERRY: Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
(Jerry puts on giant sunglasses and goes to Kramer's apartment. Newman starts eating chicken)
KRAMER: What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
NEWMAN: I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.
KRAMER: Well I'm boycotting it.
NEWMAN: (eating) hm.
(Kramer looks at the chicken.)
KRAMER: What is that, hickory?
NEWMAN: Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.
KRAMER: Really?
NEWMAN: Uh-Huh.
(Kramer reaches for some and Newman grows,)
KRAMER: Oh stop it. (he slaps Newman's shoulder) What's the matter with you.
(Kramer takes a piece of chicken and looks like he loves it)
KRAMER: Mmmmm.
[Exterior dusk shot of Heather's apartment building. Knock on Heather's door.]
HEATHER: Can I help you?
(Elaine stands in the doorway, off to the side)
ELAINE: Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
HEATHER: Oh.
ELAINE: ... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
GEORGE: Hi.
ELAINE: Ah, (releases George's ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
HEATHER: Really?
ELAINE: I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
GEORGE: Well not really...
ELAINE: George...
GEORGE: Ah... (quietly)
ELAINE:  ... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
HEATHER: Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...
GEORGE: Well that makes sense.
(George starts to leave, so Elaine grabs him by the ear and pulls him back in)
ELAINE: Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
HEATHER: Be my guest.
(Elaine drags George in by his ear)
GEORGE: Good to see you again.
(George and Elaine exit the apartment looking tired. The door shuts hard.)
GEORGE: She's bluffing...
ELAINE: Uhhh...
GEORGE: ... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
ELAINE: This is an absolute disaster.
GEORGE: Oh I don't know. Check this out.
(George holds up a golden clock he had hidden in his jacket. )
ELAINE: You stole her clock?
(George smiles)
ELAINE: Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
GEORGE: Yep, this one for our side!
[Cut to Jerry's apartment, Kramer is in Jerry's bed eating Kenny Roger's Chicken. Kramer wipes his face on Jerry's sheets, and doing so found another piece of chicken, Kramer throws it on the floor.]
[Cut to Kramer's apartment, Jerry is wide awake in the dark (red).]
JERRY: (Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
(Creaking sound, then the sound of a door opening)
JERRY: (startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
[Morning at Jerry apartment]
ELAINE: So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
KRAMER: You should sleep with him.
(Enter Jerry, his hair is like Kramer's. Jerry enters doing Kramer's slide. The red light floods the hallway from Kramer's apartment)
JERRY: Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
(rubs his eyes with the palms of his hands - fingers outstretched)
ELAINE: You look a little stressed.
JERRY: Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
ELAINE: So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
JERRY: You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
ELAINE: I thought he was Kramer's friend.
JERRY: Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
ELAINE: Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
JERRY: No, but the difference is negligible.
KRAMER: Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
ELAINE: Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
JERRY: Giddee up!
(Exit Elaine and Jerry. Newman reveals himself, he was hiding in the bathroom.)
NEWMAN: It's getting cold, it's getting cold.
KRAMER: That was a close one.
NEWMAN: Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?
KRAMER: Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
(Newman and Kramer start open the grocery bag.)
[Back to Elaine's office]
IPSWITCH: Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is Nutria.
ELAINE: w-w- Well, that's a -ah, it's kind of Sable.
IPSWITCH: No, its a kind of rat.
ELAINE: That's a rat hat?
IPSWITCH: And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors. Nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time.
ELAINE: But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
IPSWITCH: And quite mad too from what I hear.
ELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
IPSWITCH: No.
[Monk's Diner -- George and Kramer are eating together]
KRAMER: So Heather called?
GEORGE: Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
KRAMER: No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
GEORGE: She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
KRAMER: Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
GEORGE: I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
KRAMER: I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
GEORGE: Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
KRAMER: Hmm. That's a shame.
[Jerry talking to Seth inside Kenny Rogers Roasters]
JERRY: Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
SETH: Jerry I lied. I'm just an assistant manager.
SETH: (On loud speaker) Number sixty seven, family feast.
NEWMAN: Number 67, right here, right here!
JERRY: Hello Newman.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
SETH: And don't forget your steamed broccoli.
JERRY: Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
NEWMAN: I love.. broccoli, it's, good for you.
JERRY: Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
(Jerry opens container. Newman takes a piece)
NEWMAN: Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)
NEWMAN: Vile weed!
JERRY: It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
NEWMAN: Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
(Newman drinks mustard like a shot of Henningin's whiskey. He slaps his hand on the counter 7 times, adjusts his coat, coughs and exits)
[Jerry's apartment, Kramer, tapping his fork on the table with an empty plate in front of him. He is waiting for Newman. Jerry comes in. Red light floods the hallway]
KRAMER: Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey
(surprised to see Jerry, Kramer removes the napkin from his shirt front and wipes his mouth like he just finished a meal.)
JERRY: Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
KRAMER: Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
JERRY: He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
KRAMER: Oh
JERRY: ... as long as one of them is not him.
KRAMER: (laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
JERRY: Uh-ha.
KRAMER:  ... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
JERRY: I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
KRAMER: Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
JERRY: I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
JERRY: All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
KRAMER: No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
JERRY: You got a little problem.
KRAMER: Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
[shot of a map - Myanmar, Burma. Elaine is visiting Peterman in the Burmese jungle. Spooky music plays. Elaine is lead by a boy and told to sit. they are in silhouette. This scene is straight out of the movie Apocalypse Now]
BOY: Here, kneel here.
ELAINE: What?
BOY: Kneel.
ELAINE: Kneel?
(The sound of water dripping, as Peterman squeezes a cloth onto the back of his neck, ala Colonel Kurtz in the movie Apocalypse Now)
PETERMAN: Elaine.
ELAINE: Mr. Peterman.
(A boy cuts a pineapple with a large knife in the background. Elaine is startled and turns to look at him. Peterman scolds him in another language )
PETERMAN: Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)
ELAINE: You speak Burmese?
PETERMAN: No Elaine, that was gibberish.
ELAINE: Ah.
PETERMAN: So did you have any trouble finding the place?
ELAINE: No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
PETERMAN: Are you an assassin?
ELAINE: I - I work for your mail order catalog.
PETERMAN: You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
ELAINE: Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
PETERMAN: I'd be happy to Elaine (he starts reading the form as she hands him a pen)... but I will have to see this hat.
ELAINE: Right... (nodding)
[George and Heather are at a bench in the park. George is holding a white paper bag. He sits at the opposite end of the bench and sets the bag down next to him]
GEORGE: So how do you want to do this?
HEATHER: Alright George, I'll be honest. The first time we went out, I found you very irritating. But after seeing you a couple of times, you sorta got stuck in my head, (sings) Ca-stan-za! (like "By Mennen") (laughs)
GEORGE: So you - you really don't have my hat?
HEATHER: What?
(George moves his bag)
GEORGE: Uh, le - let's go do, something.
HEATHER: What's in the bag?
GEORGE: Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.
(Clock starts ringing)
GEORGE: ...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
HEATHER: (grabs the bag) My clock, you stole it!
GEORGE: That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
(Heather walks off leaving George on the bench. It starts raining)
[Jerry enters the Chicken Stand wearing the Nutria rat hat. The rain has made the hat wet]
JERRY: Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
(As Jerry talks he tries to wave his rat hat dry, because of the wetness, the hat falls apart, fur flying into everyone's plate)
JERRY: Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
SETH: That's not gonna be good for anybody.
[Kramer in bed eating chicken when ... the Kenny Roger's red Chicken light goes out]
KRAMER: (his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
(Kramer at his window with a sign saying "KENNY COME BACK" )
KRAMER: (quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
[Jerry is in bed at his own apartment]
JERRY: Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off)
(Creek!)
JERRY: Is someone there?
(the sound of scampered feet, and a shadow of the ventriloquist dummy runs across the back room wall)
JERRY: Mr. Marbles?
[Elaine with Peterman in the jungle]
ELAINE: This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
PETERMAN: The horror ... the horror.
[Jerry and George are sitting outside.]
GEORGE: Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
JERRY: Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
GEORGE: We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
JERRY: Kramer.
GEORGE: So fast? What about me?
JERRY: No.
GEORGE: Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
JERRY: Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
GEORGE: Well I would eat you.
JERRY: That's very nice, I guess.
GEORGE: I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
JERRY: Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
GEORGE: Thank you.
JERRY: Can I have a piece of that?
GEORGE: No.
[George and girlfriend Louise are at his apartment.]
LOUISE: George, I can't have sex.
GEORGE: With me or in general?
LOUISE: I went to the doctor today. I have mono.
GEORGE: Nucleosis.
LOUISE: Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.
GEORGE: No, no, pff...
LOUISE: How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?
[Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: Six weeks?
GEORGE: Yeah, six weeks.
JERRY: Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
GEORGE: I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
JERRY: Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
GEORGE: I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
JERRY: What guys?
GEORGE: Like us. (Elaine enters)
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: So it's just mono.
ELAINE: Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
JERRY: I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
ELAINE: No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
JERRY: Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
GEORGE: No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
JERRY: What?
ELAINE: Huh?
GEORGE: I think. (Pause as they all look down)
ELAINE: Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
JERRY: Hello?
KATIE: Jerry.
JERRY: Oh hi, Katie.
KATIE: Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry.
JERRY: I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
KATIE: Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry.
JERRY: Yes, all right, Katie.
KATIE: Sorry for the late notice.
JERRY: Yes, bye.
KATIE: You're the-- (He hangs up)
GEORGE: They asked you to do career day?
JERRY: Yeah, it's no big deal.
GEORGE: Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
JERRY: And you were integral.
[Edward R. Murrow Junior High School, Jerry is waiting outside classroom. Teacher enters hall.]
TEACHER: Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.
JERRY: I'm on next, right?
TEACHER: Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo...
JERRY: The guy with the lizard.
TEACHER: Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time.
[Hear kids from the classroom all say "Eww!"]
TEACHER: So can you come back tomorrow?
JERRY: I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
[Elaine and Ben eating at a restaurant.]
ELAINE: So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
BEN: I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.
ELAINE: Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
BEN: Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.
ELAINE: When do you take this exam?
BEN: I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.
ELAINE: Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
BEN: Well, um...
ELAINE: Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
BEN: Yeah.
ELAINE: All right, that's all I wanted to know.
[George and Louise sitting on his couch. He touches her leg.]
LOUISE: Mono. (George removes hand)
[Jerry and George at Monk's.]
GEORGE: It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
JERRY: So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
GEORGE: you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
JERRY: I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, buddy. How was career day?
JERRY: Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
GEORGE: You got bumped from career day?
JERRY: It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
KRAMER: They're trying to screw with your head.
JERRY: Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
KRAMER: Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
(Kramer lights cigar.)
GEORGE: Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
KRAMER: No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
LARRY: Take it outside.
KRAMER: Come on, Larry. You know me.
LARRY: It bothers people, and it's against the law.
JERRY: You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
[Outside Monk's, Kramer sees man smoking.]
KRAMER: What, did they kick you out too?
MAN: Yeah, they kicked us all out.
[At Jerry's junior high school, Jerry is outside classroom with teacher.]
TEACHER: Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker?
JERRY: No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
TEACHER: Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!
JERRY: But I was promised this slot.
TEACHER: Single file, Jerry. (Jerry joins the line)
[At Jerry's apartment, George is sitting on couch, watching Jeopardy and playing with a Rubik's cube while Jerry is talking to him.]
JERRY: Fire drill, can you believe that?
GEORGE: What is Pericles?
ALEX TREBEK: Pericles is correct.
JERRY: Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Hey, you got any matches?
JERRY: Middle drawer.
GEORGE: Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
ALEX TREBEK: We were looking for 'Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.'
KRAMER: Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)
JERRY: Hello?
KATIE: Jerry.
JERRY: Oh hi, Katie.
KATIE: I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.
JERRY: Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
GEORGE: What is Borax?
ALEX TREBEK: Yes, you're right.
KATIE: They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Ashtrays?
JERRY: No, I don't have any ashtrays.
KRAMER: Ooh, cereal bowls.
KATIE: Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.
JERRY: No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)
KRAMER: All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)
GEORGE: What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
ALEX TREBEK: We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.
JERRY: Is this a repeat?
GEORGE: No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
JERRY: Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
GEORGE: You think?
JERRY: Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
GEORGE: Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
KRAMER: Need some more matches.
JERRY: What is goin' on in there?
KRAMER: I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
JERRY: Why?
KRAMER: Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
JERRY: It doesn't?
KRAMER: Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
JERRY: All right.
KRAMER: Yeah.
[Elaine and Ben are at Monk's.]
ELAINE: So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
BEN: I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man)
ELAINE: Oh my God.
BEN: What's wrong?
ELAINE: It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
SUE ELLEN: Elaine? Hi.
ELAINE: Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
SUE ELLEN: Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.
ELAINE: Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
BEN: Well, I'm an intern.
ELAINE: Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
WOMAN: Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
ELAINE: Well, there's a doctor right here.
BEN: No there's not.
ELAINE: Can't you at least tell him what to do?
BEN: Like what?
SUE ELLEN: Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
BEN: Right. Elevate your legs!
[Elaine is giving Larry the cook flowers.]
ELAINE: I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
LARRY: I thought he was a doctor.
ELAINE: Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
GEORGE: Of course. Absolute zero!
ELAINE: What? What is with all these books?
GEORGE: I stopped having sex.
[Outside of Kramer and Jerry's apartments. A bunch of people are in the hall, which is filled with smoke.]
KRAMER: All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
JERRY: Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
KRAMER: Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
KATIE: Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.
JERRY: I was out.
KATIE: Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.
JERRY: An assembly?
KATIE: Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--
JERRY: I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
KATIE: And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.
JERRY: Superfreak?
KATIE: Yes.
[Elaine is sitting on her couch with Ben.]
ELAINE: What is your answer to number 74?
BEN: Medobolic acidosis.
ELAINE: No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
BEN: Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing.
ELAINE: Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
[George and Yankees Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams are at the ballpark.]
GEORGE: Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
JETER: Now who are you again?
GEORGE: George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
WILLIAMS: Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?
GEORGE: Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
JETER: We won the World Series.
GEORGE: In six games.
[Elaine, Jerry, and George sitting at Monk's Cafe.]
JERRY: ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
GEORGE: Nine minutes.
JERRY: How am I gonna fill two hours?
GEORGE: Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
JERRY: And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
WAITRESS: More coffee?
GEORGE: Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
WAITRESS: Si
GEORGE: Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
WAITRESS: Mute pragalas senor
GEORGE: Eh, don't mention it.
ELAINE: Portuguese?
GEORGE: Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
ELAINE: How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
JERRY: Are you all right?
ELAINE: I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
JERRY: Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
ELAINE: What? What are you talking about?
JERRY: To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
ELAINE: I don't understand.
JERRY: Exactly.
[Jerry's apartment. Kramer enters smoking.]
KRAMER: Hey buddy.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
JERRY: What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
KRAMER: What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
JERRY: It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
KRAMER: Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
JERRY: And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
KRAMER: Look away, I'm hideous.
[Kramer exits. Cut to Elaine's.
ELAINE: Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
BEN: Pooh!
ELAINE: Pooh...(laughing)
BEN: No, it's Winnie the Pooh.
[George's apartment. George is looking through a microscope.]
LOUISE: So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know.
[Monk's]
JERRY: So what did you do?
GEORGE: I told her I would have to think about it.
JERRY: But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
GEORGE: I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
JERRY: You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
GEORGE: Simple joke from a simple man.
JERRY: So you're never gonna have sex again?
GEORGE: Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
JERRY: So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
GEORGE: Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
JERRY: I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
[Jackie Chiles is on the phone in his office.]
JACKIE: My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
(Kramer enters.)
JACKIE: Oh no.
(Jackie hangs up phone.)
KRAMER: Jackie we gotta talk.
JACKIE: No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.
KRAMER: But Jackie--
JACKIE: I said out.
KRAMER: Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
JACKIE: The who?
KRAMER: The tobacco companies.
JACKIE: I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
[Cut to Elaine being mesmerized by a rotating tire.]
[Back to Chiles' office.]
JACKIE: Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?
KRAMER: No, it didn't say anything.
JACKIE: So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.
KRAMER: So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
JACKIE: Your face is my case.
[Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.]
JERRY: How ya doin'?
ELAINE: Not good. I'm a moron.
JERRY: Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
ELAINE: Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
JERRY: What for? Oh come on.
ELAINE: I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
JERRY: I think it has something to do with me.
ELAINE: You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
JERRY: (thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
ELAINE: Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
[George and Louise sit at Monk's while George is doing all sorts of scientific experiments and such.]
GEORGE: You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
LOUISE: George, I have to have sex.
GEORGE: I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
LOUISE: Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves)
GEORGE: What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
WAITRESS: Mas Café?
GEORGE: Si, por favor.
[Kramer, and Jackie begin to discuss their to tobacco representative, Ms. Wilkie.]
JACKIE: Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.
KRAMER: Who could love me?
WILKIE: I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.
JACKIE: Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.
WILKIE: All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits)
KRAMER: Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
JACKIE: You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
[Elaine's Apartment]
ELAINE: Congratulations! You passed!
BEN: Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
ELAINE: What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
BEN: I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.
ELAINE: Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
[Backstage at the junior high's auditorium.]
KATIE: Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters)
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
GEORGE: I got lost on the way over.
JERRY: Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
GEORGE: What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
JERRY: Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
GEORGE: No, the Portuguese waitress.
JERRY: The Portuguese waitress?
GEORGE: I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
KATIE: George, George, you're on.
GEORGE: No, no. I'm not going on.
JERRY: Then what'd you come down here for?
GEORGE: Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
JERRY: It's good to have you back.
KATIE: One of you has to go on.
JERRY: All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
[Jackie and Kramer in a cab.]
KRAMER: It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
JACKIE: It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.
KRAMER: Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
JACKIE: A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.
KRAMER: She made an offer. I took it.
JACKIE: How much?
KRAMER: No, no, no. There was no money.
JACKIE: No money? Then what'd we get?
KRAMER: Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
JACKIE: This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
[Jerry talking on the phone with David Letterman.]
JERRY: Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
LETTERMAN: Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?
JERRY: Actually, it was a ********.
LETTERMAN: those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?
JERRY: Jerry.
LETTERMAN: Right. Jerry.
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's sitting at the table, reading the paper. George bursts into the room)
GEORGE: Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
JERRY: (Gets up) Get out!
GEORGE: I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
JERRY: (Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
GEORGE: (Definite) Oh yeah.
JERRY: So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
GEORGE: You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
JERRY: She's out.
GEORGE: (Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
JERRY: Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
GEORGE: Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
JERRY: I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
GEORGE: (Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
JERRY: (Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
GEORGE: (Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
[Setting: Manhattan Mini-storage]
(Jerry and Kramer both go up to a unit door. Kramer's pulling a wagon full of junk. He starts to cough uncontrollably)
JERRY: (Disgusted) What is with that?!
KRAMER: Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
JERRY: (Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
KRAMER: Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
JERRY: You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
KRAMER: Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
(Jerry opens the door, mail bags start spilling out of the unit)
JERRY: (Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
KRAMER: (Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
[Setting: George's new apartment]
(George is moving in. The place is bare. A woman walks in while he's attempting to hang a lamp near the fire place)
RICARDI: Excuse me, George? (H1)
GEORGE: (Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
RICARDI: (Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.
GEORGE: Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
tward Mrs. Ricadi. She backs off defensively) Come on! (Stops and laughs right before running into her)
RICARDI: No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.
GEORGE: (Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
RICARDI: Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to give it to him.
GEORGE: (Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
RICARDI: (Correcting) Shipwreck.
GEORGE: I remember.. (Leaves)
[Setting: Restaurant]
(Elaine is sitting alone, waiting for her date - Alan. She's thinking to herself)
ELAINE: Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
(A waiter approaches)
WAITER: Excuse me, Elaine Benes?
ELAINE: Yeah?
WAITER: An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. (Pause) He's been stabbed.
ELAINE: (Shocked) Stabbed?!
WAITER: More bread?
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
JERRY: (Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
ELAINE: That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
JERRY: Did you find out who stabbed him?
ELAINE: Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
JERRY: (Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
ELAINE: Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
(Kramer enters)
KRAMER: (Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
JERRY AND ELAINE: Hey.
KRAMER: Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
JERRY: There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
KRAMER: (Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
JERRY: (In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
KRAMER: (Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
(Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face. George enters)
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey. How's the new place?!
GEORGE: Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
ELAINE: Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
JERRY: (Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
ELANE: I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.
JERRY: (Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
GEORGE: (Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
ELAINE: I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
KRAMER: (Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
(Everyone's taken back by Kramer's knowledge)
GEORGE: How do you know?
KRAMER: it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
GEORGE: 51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
KRAMER: There were 1,650 survivors.
GEORGE: That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
KRAMER: Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
(George opens the door, and enters Kramer's apartment. Jerry stops Kramer before he can do the same)
JERRY: Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
KRAMER: Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
(Jerry nods his head - like it was expected)
[Setting: Newman's apartment]
(Jerry knocks on the door as it opens slowly. Newman's sitting on the couch, watching TV in a state of depression)
JERRY: Newman?
NEWMAN: (Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.
JERRY: Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
NEWMAN: Sometimes we don't get what we want.
JERRY: (Confused) What are you talking about?
NEWMAN: I didn't get my transfer.
JERRY: "Transfer"?
NEWMAN: To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm hanging it up.
JERRY: You quit the post office?
NEWMAN: Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.
JERRY: Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
NEWMAN: And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.
JERRY: (Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)
[Setting: Central Park]
(Kramer's sitting on a bench coughing. A man walking some dogs passes. A coughing other than Kramer's can be heard. Kramer stops the man)
KRAMER: Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
MAN: What cough?
(One of his dogs, Smuckers, coughs. Kramer reacts while pointing to the dog)
[Setting: Restaurant]
(Elaine's on a date with Alan)
ELAINE: I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
ALAN: No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy.
ELAINE: (Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
ALAN: Just.. one of those things, you know.
ELAINE: What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
ALAN: I don't know. Could be.
(A woman, Carol, passes. She stops infront of Elaine and Alan's table)
CAROL: Alan?!
ALAN: Carol?
(Carol grabs his hot coffee, and throws it in his face, then storms off. Alan screams from the pain)
ELAINE: (Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
ALAN: (Between screams) No, that was a different girl.
(Elaine looks confused. Scene ends)
[Setting: Coffee shop]
JERRY: There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
ELAINE: Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
JERRY: Mmm.. Bad how?
ELAINE: (Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
JERRY: (Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
ELAINE: Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
JERRY: (Agreeing) What's more important?
(Elaine shrugs, then Jerry shrugs, then Elaine, then they both get into sort of a shrug-off)
[Setting: NYC Street]
(While Kramer's walking with his new found dog, Smuckers, he meets up with George. Kramer and the dog both start coughing)
KRAMER: (Between coughs) Hey.
GEORGE: What's with the dog?
KRAMER: (Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
GEORGE: Oh..
(Smuckers coughs)
KRAMER: (Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
GEORGE: A vet?
KRAMER: Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
GEORGE: So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
KRAMER: (Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
[Setting: George's apartment building]
(George approaches Mr. Eldridge as he's entering his new apartment. George is carrying Kramer's sea tales book)
GEORGE: Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
ELDRIDGE: Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.
GEORGE: I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
ELDRIDGE: (Defensively) We had to abandon ship.
GEORGE: Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
ELDRIDGE: The boat sank.
GEORGE: (Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
ELDRIDGE: Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you. (Enters his apartment, and slams the door behind him)
GEORGE: (Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
[Setting: Vet's office]
(Smuckers is getting examined by a vet)
VET: What are the symptoms?
KRAMER: Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
VET: Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?
KRAMER: (Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..
[Setting: Coffee shop]
ALAN: So that's it? We're, uh, we're breakin' up?
ELAINE: (Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
ALAN: (Fast) Ok, yeah, sure, fine, right. Whatever you say.
ELAINE: (Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
ALAN: Ok, then, well, So.. see ya around.. big head. (Gets up to leave)
ELAINE: Pardon?
ALAN: You got a big head. It's too big for your body. (Walks for the door)
ELAINE: (Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
GEORGE: So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
JERRY: You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
GEORGE: (Interested) I should!
JERRY: I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
GEORGE: I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
JERRY: You're the man!
(There's an urgent knocking at the door. Jerry answer it. Newman's standing in the doorway)
NEWMAN: Jerry!
JERRY: I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
GEORGE: Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
JERRY: (Angered) Hello.. Newman.
NEWMAN: (Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!
JERRY: What's the difference?
NEWMAN: The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!
JERRY: Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
NEWMAN: Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.
JERRY: You're giving up that easy?
NEWMAN: I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.
JERRY: (Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
NEWMAN: (Intrigued) What are you proposing?
JERRY: (Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
NEWMAN: An alliance?
JERRY: (Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's sorting mail out on his table)
ELAINE: Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
JERRY: (Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
ELAINE: Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
JERRY: "Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.
ELAINE: (Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
(The phone rings. Jerry answers it)
JERRY: Hello?
GEORGE: (On the other line) Hey.
JERRY: Hey, George.
GEORGE: Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
JERRY: You can't make it?
GEORGE: Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
JERRY: Alright. (Hangs up)
ELAINE: Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
JERRY: (Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
ELAINE: (Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
JERRY: Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
JERRY: (Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
KRAMER: (Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
JERRY: Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
KRAMER: I don't want to!
(Jerry forces Kramer onto the couch. Kramer resists violently - much like a dog would)
JERRY: C'mon. Just sit down!
KRAMER: (Squirming) Jerry! What?!
JERRY: Sit down! Sit down!
KRAMER: (Struggling) Hey!
JERRY: Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
(Jerry forces the pill into Kramer's mouth, then holds Kramer's mouth shut for a few moments. Thinking Kramer's already swallowed it, he lets go. Instantly, Kramer spits the pill out into the air. Jerry sighs, giving up)
JERRY: (Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
KRAMER: Whe have the same symptoms.
JERRY: But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
KRAMER: No, no. No doctors.
JERRY: Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
KRAMER: Where are you going?
JERRY: I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
KRAMER: I don't know..
JERRY: (Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
(Kramer eagerly gets up and runs out the door. Jerry follows Kramer out)
[Setting: Taxi cab]
(Elaine's riding in the back seat of a taxi)
DRIVER: Lady, could you move your head a little bit?
ELAINE: What?
DRIVER: Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and forehead can be seen) Thank you.
[Setting: Jerry's car]
(Jerry is driving to an unknown destination. Kramer is restless in the back. He's scrambling around, looking out the windows - just as a dog would)
KRAMER: I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
[Setting: Coffee shop]
(George is at the coffee shop with his parents)
GEORGE: So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
ESTELLE: I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.
FRANK: Get outta here! We have a booth.
ESTELLE: Frank, I'm cold!
FRANK: Order a hot dish.
ESTELLE: Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)
FRANK: (Yelling) That's not a booth!
ESTELLE: (Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!
FRANK: (Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)
ESTELLE: (Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
(A moment passes)
GEORGE: (Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
FRANK: Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?
GEORGE: (Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
FRANK: (Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?
[Setting: NYC Street]
(Jerry's car is parked outside of the doctor's office. Kramer refuses to get out of the car)
JERRY: Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
KRAMER: No, Jerry!
JERRY: Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
KRAMER: No! Don't!
(Jerry pulls Kramer out onto the sidewalk. Kramer quickly gets up and takes off - running down the street)
JERRY: Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
[Setting: Tenant board room]
(Mr. Eldridge is telling his story to the board members. Each one looked touched by the tale. George, on the other hand, is bored to death. He's leaning back in his chair in the corner of the room, knocking on the wall - to display how bored he is)
ELDRIDGE: Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. (Stops, then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls) It was the sweetest sight my eyes ever saw.
RICARDI: (Touched) Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.
(George gets up, walks over to Mr. Eldridge, then gestures for him to give up his chair. Eldridge reluctantly gets up and takes George's seat in the corner)
[Setting: Newman's apartment]
(Jerry enters. Newman has an ice pac on his ankle)
JERRY: Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
NEWMAN: Kramer bit me!
JERRY: Bit you?!
NEWMAN: We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route - and they're awarding the transfer in two days!
JERRY: (Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?
NEWMAN: You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!
JERRY: Well, why not?
NEWMAN: (Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..
JERRY: What am I gonna wear?
NEWMAN: I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.
JERRY: (Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
(Scene cuts to Jerry on Newman's route. He's walking along a city street with a mail cart. He stops infront of a store owner brooming the sidewalk)
JERRY: (Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
OWNER: Mail on Sunday?
JERRY: (Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
[Setting: Tenant board room]
(George is telling the board his astonishing life stories. Every board member seems to be deeply moved by them)
GEORGE: I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
[Setting: Newman's apartment]
(Jerry returns to get another bag of mail)
JERRY: Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
NEWMAN: "Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand.. very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)
JERRY: What?
NEWMAN: That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!
JERRY: How did they know?!
NEWMAN: (Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!
JERRY: (Pleading) I tried my best!
NEWMAN: Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office badge from Jerry's coat)
JERRY: You know, this is your coat.
NEWMAN: (Realizing) Damn!
[Setting: Central park]
(Elaine passes a man on a bench. All the sudden, a bird flies right into Elaine's head, and falls to the ground. The bird regains it's balance, and flies off. The man on the bench is staring in awe)
MAN 2: He flew right into your head. Like he couldn't avoid it.
ELAINE: (Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
MAN 2: Never seen that before. Bird into a woman's head..
(Elaine covers her head with her hands, and runs off)
[Setting: Coffee shop]
GEORGE: It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
JERRY: Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
GEORGE: They're making their decision today.
(Elaine enters. She has a scarf over her head - trying to tie her hair down. She looks angered at something)
JERRY: What's the matter with you?
ELAINE: Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
JERRY: What giant freak-head?
ELAINE: (Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
JERRY: So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
ELAINE: (Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
JERRY: (Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
ELAINE: (Getting up to leave) Alright.
[Setting: Restaurant]
ALAN: I want to apologize for..
ELAINE: (Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
ALAN: So you have a big head.
ELAINE: (Casually playing along) So what?
ALAN: It goes well with that bump in your nose.
ELAINE: (Suddenly angry) What?!
(Scene cuts to the outside of the restaurant. A woman runs out of the restaurant and stops a passing Kramer)
WOMAN: Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
(Kramer takes off running down the street, looking for a cop. He meets up with two officers exiting an ice cream shop. Before he can tell them the urgent message, he starts coughing uncontrollably)
COP: Boy, that's some cough you got there.
(Kramer keeps coughing while making gestures)
COP 2: No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it? (Between coughs, Kramer manages to say the word "trouble") Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's trouble? (Kramer coughs out the words "Old Mill") Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my god! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on.
(Kramer starts running back to the restaurant, the cops following him)
[Setting: George's apartment building]
(George enters the hallway only to find that a bandaged-up Alan is moving boxes into George's would-be-apartment)
GEORGE: Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
ALAN: I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands)
GEORGE: What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
ALAN: Yeah.
GEORGE: Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
ALAN: Oh, fork in the forehead.
GEORGE: That's why they gave you the apartment?
ALAN: No, I just gave the super 50 bucks.
GEORGE: Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
ALAN: Tough luck, chinless. (Goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on George)
(George starts acting self-conscious about his chin - much like Elaine and her head)
[Jerry and Elaine are waiting on the street for George.]
JERRY: So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
ELAINE: I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
JERRY: Five minutes.
ELAINE: Five minutes? That's it?
JERRY: What's the difference? You never showed up.
ELAINE: I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
JERRY: Well, we barely knew the guy.
ELAINE: So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
JERRY: That's the way it works.
ELAINE: When did you tell George to be here?
JERRY: I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
ELAINE: About five.
JERRY: That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
GEORGE (looks at his watch): Early! Alright! (shivers.) Cold.
[Jerry and Kramer in a booth at the coffee shop.]
KRAMER: So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
JERRY: How did you know about that?
KRAMER: Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
JERRY: He can't do that.
KRAMER (sternly): It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
(George enters and sits down.)
GEORGE: Fantastic day! Fantastic!
JERRY: What happened?
GEORGE: (laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
JERRY: Fantastic.
GEORGE: Then, I'm at The Foundation...
JERRY: You're still doing that?
GEORGE: Sometimes, once in a while.
JERRY: When you feel guilty.
GEORGE: No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
KRAMER: That's caged heat.
GEORGE: Yeah-hah!
JERRY: What are you gonna do there?
GEORGE: Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
JERRY: Yes, I know, I know.
GEORGE: I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
JERRY: It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
(Elaine enters with her new boyfriend, Kurt.)
ELAINE: Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
KRAMER: Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.
KURT: Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.
KRAMER: Yes! These
